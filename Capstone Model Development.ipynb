The combat was meh, but could have been improved with upgrades to weapons or combos and such, and the story was standard but interesting enough.\\n\\nIt was downhill after that. The combat continues to be meh, but worse it became boring, tedious *and* annoying. Weapons barely differ in appearance, none at all in animation and has a single attack stat that ticks up by 2s and 3s every time you upgrade. No new combos either: what you learn in the tutorial is what you get, but hey, you can chain some of them longer!\\n\\nCharacter progression is equally bland, skill trees do nothing interesting other than tweak a percentage here or there or let you do something a bit more often or more of them at the same time. No unique skills to unlock.\\n\\nThe only bright spot is that some of the side characters are funny, which is balanced by some of them being annoying as hell. Out something like 8 side characters I only care about 2, the rest were only useful for the skills they provided.

The combat is the very definition of mid. You have to unlock the most basic ass moves in the skilltree like \\\"double jump\\\" \\\"dodging mid air\\\" and \\\"having a longer basic combo then just 3 hits\\\". In terms of Action games this is worlds behind what other titles like DMC and Bayonetta had long established. In terms of RPG mechanics its not much better since the gear upgrades are only adding such low numbered boosts each time that the whole upgrade system just comes off as a lame afterthought that could have just been left out and noone would have noticed. Literally the only good thing about the combat is the flashy animations, thats it. Doesnt help that the game seems to have a very low vareity of enemies since you run into reskins of allready established enemies really early. At the point i was at i had fought the Rival character as the end of stage boss like 3 times in a row and what had followed in terms of story explaination just made me outright quit. \\n\\nThe story is allready allover the fucking place mixing all kinds of anime tropes and making them like 100 times worse. Main Character has Memory issues, the government is evil, noone wants to ever stop and explain their reasoning instead we gotta fight each other and everytime we're about to get answers theres a conviently placed interruption that allows the otherside to retreat and keep their stupid mouths shut for the sake of building up some dumb revelation. And then at the same time you keep getting messages from your enemies along the lines off \\\"Hey i know my side wants you dead and all but we should definetly meet at this convenient little restaurant that for some reason doesnt side with anyone and have a heart to heart\\\" and then your character for very good reason goes \\\"Okay, now explain wtf is going with you guys!\\\" and is only met with \\\"Nah forget about that, lets instead talk about what kinda girls you like\\\". I can only suspend my disbelief so far, this shit reads like they believe the player is stupid and forgot what happened 5 minutes prior.\\n\\nI genuinely can not recommend this game to anyone, i don't even know who it was made for. If you want an anime style rpg play the tales of series. If you want an action game then play dmc or bayonetta.

That would be fine for conversation heavy scenes honestly, but they also use them for ACTION SCENES??? It just comes off as bizarre and awkward and makes certain scenes hard to follow. Whenever it actually has an animated cutscene it always looks fantastic and it just makes me sad they had to resort to such a cheap looking presentation for most of it.\\n\\nThe other issue is the story is divided between two protagonists on separate sides of a conflict, but instead of delivering a satisfying story for each, you're instead stuck for most of the game left in the total dark about What The Fuck is happening until the final act. So much that happens just isn't set up or explained well at all UNLESS if you were playing as the other character.

It's very free form and you can think up of any combos you want to do, though you'll have to level up to get to that point.  \\nAesthetic is great too, I'm really a huge fan of the post-apocalyptic art style that Bandai-Namco has been using for God Eater and Code Vein.  \\n  \\nCons: Literally everything else. The story is garbage, the dialogue is garbage, the characters are all unlikable (Except Shiden, who's ironically likeable). It's funny how the promotional material shows all of these awesome animated cutscenes but the game itself is told in this stupid manga style where you essentially just have pictures talking to each other. It's not a great form of telling a story, and if they really believed it was, they would have shown it in the trailers. There are points in time where this absolutely horrendous form of storytelling cannot fully embody what its trying to convey, so they switch it to a cut-scene. The cutscenes are awesome, but they literally only make up 1% of the way the story is told. \\n\\nAlso, as great as the combat is, no dodge cancelling is like a nail in the coffin for a fast-paced action game. Have fun being knocked around mid-combo with no way to move out of the way until late in the game where you can get an item that lets you ignore knockback.  \\n  \\nTL;DR: Get this game if you like fun action gameplay, but skip the cutscenes. Trust me, you are not missing much.  \\n  \\nPS. There are 2 stories to do, I only finished one.

While it has an interesting battle system, the lack of substance in both characters and story, coupled with lots of repetitiveness really drag this game down into something I cannot recommend.\\n\\nGameplay Loop: This is an RPG where you can choose to play as one of two characters per playthrough. There is a heavy focus on story and combat, without much else to do. Exploration is limited as each area is fairly linear and your only ability to revisit those areas is for purposes of equipment gathering or completing quests. While the battle system has some unique elements to it (combining powers with your teammates or going into overdrive type modes), the variety of enemies is fairly limited as you'll see the same type of enemy repeated throughout different environments with little variation. Each enemy has their own shtick to beating them, but it's rather lame. All of your teammates are also very lame (fight me) and offer little assistance during battles. It's basically the MC and that's it for dealing damage. 3/5.\\nStory: The story is very B-anime, and not in a good way (as I love lots of anime). You start as part of a government anti-\\\"Other\\\" task force, basically tasked with defeating strange alien like creatures that suddenly appeared years ago using your psionic powers. The plot goes through twists and turns from there, but it was all b-movie grade stuff. The supporting characters I found very lame and while there is a persona-lite kind of bond portion of the game, I found myself skipping it because the stories were all so lame. I cared not a lick for the characters, including the main ones (I played through as Kasane to about 75% of the way through) and thought most of the scenes were cringey. other reviews commented on the presentation as it like a VN when they have people talking and it wasn't the best delivery method here as it was stills of the in-game graphics, not even hand drawn for more expression. 2/5 for me.\\nMusic: I saw lots of other people in the reviews saying how much they loved the music. I thought it was ok there were some decent songs and some really 'meh' songs IMHO. Most of the tracks were generic techno. I'd say this was a 3.5/5 for me.\\nGraphics: It wasn't hard on my laptop but the graphics were nice and battle animations and enemies were all unique. The level layouts though could have used some more work as a lot of the areas were just all the same from the start point to the end with little variety. Felt like I was running through the same ice hallway in the ice level, the same grey boxes in the Togetsu level and it just didn't do much for me. 3/5.\\nFun-factor: I tried to like this game, played for over 17 hours and even after abandoning trying to max level the bonds and ignoring the side-quests and battle simulations training (which are just super long drawn out battles against normal enemies, at least the ones I did) I just ended up not caring enough to slog through the rest of the game. I'll wikipedia the ending. I couldn't imagine finishing this game and then re-playing through it as the alternate character. The battles, which have to be the big draw since that's all you do, were decent for a little while but then just got boring after fighting the same enemies over and over. 2/5 fun for me.\\nOverall: I would not recommend this game.

The level design is incredibly boring and repetitive, mostly having you walk through long hallways, with lots of backtracking and repeated visits tot he same areas if you want to get all the items in the level. You also seem to need these items, because there's a level of grind to the game which requires you to defeat certain enemies and explore levels repeatedly in the hope that the materials you need will drop so you can craft weapons and upgrades. \\nSomething I have mixed feelings about is the game focusing heavily on bonding with your teammates so you can gain new abilities (which are very cool and fun to use), but unfortunately this sucks because the characters are all generic anime tropes who have no real personalities to speak of, and who you need to buy gifts for and watch cutscenes with (usually with no gameplay) to increase your bond. \\nThe story feels like it's trying to be as convoluted as possible with the amount of plot twists it has, but it fails in it's storytelling because it relies on the characters acting like idiots who have difficulty understanding anything and flat out refuse to explain anything to each other. There's also a problem of constant exposition dumps that make you feel like the writers think you're a low IQ drooling knuckle dragger who can't follow the plot, and on top of that they waste so much time in cutscenes by making every member of your party (Which ends up being 12 characters, not including other NPC's) chime in with something to say in every cutscene, no matter how inane and repetitive it is. A character says something incredibly simple, another character repeats it back to them like it's some big confusing revelation that they're struggling to understand, and then the first character says something like \\\"in other words\\\" or \\\"in simple terms\\\" and then just repeats themselves, and a minute later some other character shows up and they go over it all again, and then an hour later they go over it another time, and then another hour later they bring it up again etc. This applies to gameplay as well, when all the support characters are constantly telling you how to use your abilities, or how to defeat enemies you've already fought dozens of times. I found myself rolling my eyes a lot during cutscenes, but I could imagine your typical anime fan having no issues getting through all of that stuff.

Go somewhere to find someone or something, enemies spawn while you\\u2019re doing that, rinse and repeat. That\\u2019s the entire game. It\\u2019s really not open world, as maps are just one huge point A and point B. Combined with the fact that side quests are just fetch quests you need to go out of your way to do is also annoying (as the game already feels like one huge fetch quest).\\n - Story is pretty slow moving (which doesn\\u2019t help given the above point either). It\\u2019s one of those stories where something bad happens, then that leads to some other bad thing happening, and then all of a sudden the world isn\\u2019t what it seems anymore (not a spoiler, you\\u2019ve seen that trope before).\\n - With what I\\u2019ve discussed, the main thing is that you just don\\u2019t feel a sense of progress a lot of the time. There are two story modes essentially, and it took me months of playing this game on and off just to finish one of the stories. Your mileage may vary though.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s the very good stuff though:\\n - This has got to be some of the most satisfying combat I\\u2019ve ever felt in a game. It is very unique and feels good once you\\u2019re in the flow of the combat. It gets more complex later in the game, but it\\u2019s all pretty manageable, and using the various abilities is fun and doesn\\u2019t feel confusing at all.\\n - Art direction is awesome. It\\u2019s anime combined with a high fidelity sort of realism, plus cel shaded environments that don\\u2019t feel cartoony. It\\u2019s a combination I haven\\u2019t seen in any other game yet.\\n - Music is a jam. It ranges from jpop to industrial to breakcore and basically everything in between. I wish more game soundtracks were as creative as this one.\\n - Characters are pretty cool with the exception of the cringe and annoying ones (Shiden and Tsugumi), and every line of text in the game is voice acted, so you don\\u2019t have to read books worth of dialogue. The bonding episodes make for good breaks from the action as well.\\n\\nI was surprised that some things really fell flat for me, but I guess I\\u2019m just one of those people where if the game\\u2019s style is awesome, then I\\u2019d sit through it and probably like it in the end.\\n\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.03470404723905387, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"This game is pretty great.

I also had no technical issues. That's about it.\\n\\nThe story is poorly constructed. Nothing really has any impact on anything. there are about 5 chapters (or phases as they're called) that could've been skipped had the 2 parties simply spoken to each other for 5 minutes. That was really silly.\\nThen there's the fun combat which can turn sour when you actually hit all the right things on the enemy and it just needlessly takes so long to take them down after the fact. this becomes especially apparent and very frustrating and tedious in the final dungeon where you battle about 6 major enemies every few steps that you have to kill to progress.\\nSurely it was a mistake on my part to play this on Hard. It just added tedium.\\n\\nThe characters sadly don't keep you engaged either. They have some archetype / trope attached to them and then they milk that and keep milking and keep changing nothing and then you're at the end.

Supposedly they have weak spots but actually hitting them makes such an insignificant difference to how quickly you kill something. At least it looks kinda cool, so there's that although the OST is just kinda there. No memorable tracks whatsoever.\\n\\nIt was kinda okay and fun in the beginning but when more and more of those giant enemies with their idiotic large healthbars and stagger bars kept being the norm it was just so bogged down and unrewarding to play this game.

Damn, those really surpassed my expectations! When it comes to these aspects, I'm utterly speechless. The combat become better and better once you get midway through the story, since that's when you start to unlock more of the skill tree. It's a bit odd that the basic attack is so limited when you're at a low level - especially since this is a JRPG. This could make sense if it's for skills, but here, even the basic attack is minimal. Nevertheless, I found the final boss battle as my best play in this game, unlike other tedious boss fights. It truly pushes the limit of skill, which is challenging and precisely why I enjoyed it. Furthermore, the soundtracks are catchy and quite pleasing. My favorites are \\\"Scarlet Nexus\\\" (yes, this is the soundtrack name), \\\"Suoh,\\\" and \\\"Broken Promise.\\\". And the last for good part in this game, the enemy character design is another high point - shoutout to the design team. It may be a bit too much for JRPG, feeling more suited for a horror game, but it works.\\n\\nHowever, this game has alot of unbearable things. You may have already seen other reviews mentioning this: the main story can fry your brain if you take it too seriously. The early premise had me hooked, after phases two or three, the plot become worse and worse. It feels like the story was penned by multiple authors with different storytelling styles. Moreover, this game has two unique perspectives or walkthroughs of the story that initially intersect slightly, but eventually merge into one. One perspective is from Yuito Sumeragi, with his team, and the other is from Kasane Randall and her squad. But because the creators likely wanted to deliver different experiences with limited resources and budget, the execution on this aspect fell short. In the end, both stories become unbearable to play and almost every chapter or phase has an odd start and finish, at least to me. Given that Yuito and Kasane each have their own teams, the roster of characters is extensive, yet each character lacks depth or uniqueness other than their backstory and voice acting. Speaking of which, the voice acting is notably poor in this game, similar to AI-trained generated voices that lack chemistry with their respective characters. As for the animation, while it's superb as I said before, most of the game's dialogues are on par with powerpoint slideshow. At first, I thought this unique 'slideshow' approach could give different experience, but overtime it becomes monotonous due to the characters' lack of expressiveness. The game has lot of maps, and each is fairly huge, but they feel empty and underutilized in the main story. Finally, I skipped a lot of the \\\"bond episodes\\\" because they were simply too boring. I gave the first two couple attempts a shot each characters, but they just weren't engaging enough.\\n\\n[spoiler] Another note: Even though, I roast the story aspect in this game, it's better than anime one. [/spoiler]\\n\\nIn conclusion, it seems like the game's direction shifted frequently during development, given the promising premise but poor execution. Well, if you're just looking for casual play and don't care too much about the story, you can give it a try. But if you're like me and you love good story in your JRPGs, you might want to pass on this one.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.032026474500103035, \"joke\": 1, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"idk what the hell is going on\\n\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.02836226267468265, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Good storyline, the story pace is slow at first 2 to 3 hours, but it's getting better after that.

This was sort of annoying at first, but by the end I didn't notice it. \\n\\nEnvironment textures were pretty low quality in some areas. I noticed it in the city areas mostly, but it was especially bad in cutscenes, where textures were extremely blocky and low-res. A lot of the areas weren't particularly nice to look at, and I don't say this often, but the grey environments of the [spoiler]Togetsu's BABE facility (yeah, stupid name for a supercomputer) and Arahabaki[/spoiler] were just drab. Inside the [spoiler]\\\"Red Strings\\\" or Kunad Gate as it were[/spoiler], was one area that looked really cool to me. Inside [spoiler]Karen's brain field towards the end of the game[/spoiler] was quite unique as well.\\n\\nThe enemies, or \\\"Others\\\" as they're called, are so freakin' weird (in a good way). It's nice to see originality! \\n\\nThe non-animated cutscenes were a mix of static imagery with voiced dialogue and some very basic facial movement. The scenes that were actually animated were much better, in my opinion.\\n\\nWhere this game doesn't miss in the graphics department, though, is the character design. Each of the characters were visually unique and crisp. Good job here!\\n\\n[b]Story:[/b] I chose Kasane as my character. I am unsure just how much is different if you play as Yuito, but I was satisfied with my single playthrough. \\n\\nThis story was absolutely wild. There is just SO much going on. It's like they just took good individual ideas that would be the centrepiece of any normal story and mashed them all together in rapid succession. I swear I got whiplash from the slew of things that kept happening in the first half (roughly) of the game. \\n\\nOne thing that bugged me was that throughout all of these crazy things happening, sometimes the characters didn't really seem to portray that craziness in their dialogue. They all just carried on as if this stuff was just everyday life for them. I suppose that if you had special abilities like they did, maybe the rest of it wouldn't feel so outrageous. Still, it made it feel inconsequential. There were so many back flips and plot twists that a lot of it started to fall flat. \\n\\nBut that changed in the second half. Once they focused on a clear goal, it was a lot better. There were a lot of truly heartfelt moments in there, both sad and warm, and the ending of the game was really good. Despite an overwhelming start, the later half really pulled everything together nicely and I was very satisfied with it.\\n\\nAs an aside to the story, the bonds you could foster and improve with the other characters really helped to add a lot of weight to the game as well. \\n\\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] I started out on MKB but switched to a controller and had a much smoother time.  \\n\\nCombat takes some getting used to. There are so many tutorials and so many different UI elements to be aware of at any one time. You've got your own standard health bar, plus your Psychokinesis bar which is used for your personal abilities. Then you've got the Brain Drive gauge which is like a power up mode, and the Brain Field gauge which is like a mega power up mode. You also have all of your allies' health and SAS gauges to keep an eye on. At the beginning it really felt like I was getting thrown into the deep end. \\n\\nOnce you do get used to it, though, it feels nice and flashy. It's so satisfying to nail combos and keep stringing together everyone's various SAS abilities and your own attacks. \\n\\nSince each ally has their own SAS ability, and you can have up to 4 allies in your SAS party (different from your physical party, which caps out at you plus two other allies), you end up with so many different ways to take on your enemies, which is very, very satisfying! When you unlock the ability to [spoiler]use two SAS abilities concurrently[/spoiler], it really kicks it up a notch. And then unlocking the ability that lets you [spoiler]use four at the same time[/spoiler] is just awesome! AND THEN when [spoiler]you have all the allies in your party and you have two sets of 4 SAS abilities[/spoiler] to use, it really makes you feel powerful.\\n\\nThe combat in this game is definitely one of the better hack and slash type combat systems I've experienced!\\n\\nThe only negative I really have to say about the combat is the dodge. Because you get animation locked during attacks, you can't dodge half the time when you see an enemy's attack coming. This was especially frustrating when using certain SAS abilities, because it would enhance one of Kasane's regular attacks, resulting in a much, much longer animation. Longer animation = more time for your enemy to smack you. I never really found a good workaround for this. Attacking once, then moving away, then attacking once again to try and wait for your enemy to make a move first just didn't feel right. It definitely felt much better just stringing together combos, despite getting knocked down mid way.\\n\\nOne combat section that really stood out to me was the whole fight with [spoiler]Karen[/spoiler]!\\n\\nLinked to combat, I have to mention the Brain Map; this game's version of a skill tree. It reminded me of Final Fantasy's sphere grid, which I loved. I found the abilities to all be impactful and by the end of my playthrough I had around 80% of them.\\n\\nMoving away from the combat, there are a few other gameplay points I wanted to touch on. \\n\\nSide quests in this game were more like challenges. You pick them up from NPCs while roaming certain city maps and they all focus on taking out certain enemies in certain ways. At first I thought this was a bit odd, but the more I think about it, the more it seems to fit this combat-focused game. Instead of forcing you to do menial tasks like helping old Gertrude cross the road, they just get you to do combat related things that you might already be doing anyway, so it actually fits the game quite nicely. I actually really liked the way they handled the handing-in of side quests, too. You just open your quest menu and hand it in right there. No need to go running all the way back to where you got it. I honestly hope to see more games using this feature.\\n\\n[b]Bugs:[/b] None.\\n\\n[b]Final thoughts:[/b] This game's story has an overwhelming first half. So much so that I began wishing it was over already. However, the later half of the story really turned things around and that was when I really started enjoying it. Still, as much as I did end up enjoying the story, where this game truly shines is the combat, and there was very little to criticise about it. This game caught my eye because of the combination of flashy combat and the anime aesthetic. After playing through it, I am happy to report that it does not feel like a traditional JRPG (which I think is a stagnating genre, but I digress). I am glad to have experienced it.\\n\\n[b]Do I recommend this game?[/b] Yes. Even at full price, there is enough content in this game to justify it.

The two protagonist things sound neat in theory, but combined with the sheer length of even one of the routes and the overall quality of the game, playing through mostly the same game twice becomes something you quickly come to dread instead. \\n\\nThe nice aesthetics of the game world and enemies and the times where the combat actually works as intended instead of collapsing under its flaws are not enough to carry the entire experience.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.05508798126327399, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"great game\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.03007061323443854, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"hi\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.0415367360821635, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"^_^ <(\\\")\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.7133578862957891, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Scarlet Nexus is an excellent JRPG with a focus on team based combat and fast paced action. The game is set in a world where ESPER powers and cybernetic enhancement are  commonplace as well as the existence of monsters known as Others (don't know who came up with that name but it's typical anime flare so I'm used to it). It follows a group of government ESPER agents who hunt down Others and in the process uncover a larger conspiracy that involves human experiments, the origin of Others and the moon. It's a tad bit convoluted and filled with anime story beats but it's well executed. \\n\\nMy main gripes with the presentation though is the lack of actually animated cut-scenes. The conversation happen with still images and talking heads, it can be a bit jarring at times but the game does know when to go fully animated during pivotal moments. I wonder why they didn't just used animated skits like in the Tales series but I suppose it does give the game it's own identity.\\n\\nAs for the combat it starts off as a bit simplistic, standard attacks with telekinesis to break and stagger opponents. You also get access to SAS which allow you to temporarily use your teammates abilities and is very useful depending on the type of enemy your facing. The true combat potential of the game really shines when you finally have access to all your teammates and their abilities. The way combat flows from this point becomes almost an intricate dance with the game showing you problems and you use your abilities to solve them, quickly shifting abilities to make combat as sweet as possible.

It feels like everything that happens is bringing me out of the immersion. I chose the Yuito route, and he's speaking his emotions out loud for all his companions to hear, announcing events that just happened like the player is blind and needs the story read to them.\\n\\nI just finished the chapter where Kasane [spoiler]betrays Yuito, murders his father, and after nearly killing him too, runs off[/spoiler] with Shiden (the electric dude) and Kyoka. And then they BOTH message Yuito with a bond episode like nothing even happened!!\\n\\nI played Shiden's to see what would happen, expecting answers. I give him his last parting gift from his captain who died in battle, who he REALLY looked up to, and not only does Yuito not want answers about his [spoiler]father's murderer[/spoiler], Shiden abandons all character growth and continues being a d\\u2665\\u2665\\u2665 to the MC. If Yuito gave half-a-s\\u2665\\u2665\\u2665 about what happened about finding answers, or saving his friends, he would have used Seto's mask as a bargaining chip for information. Sidenote, the diner has happy patrons in the background, but the [spoiler]city was literally under siege from Others that same chapter[/spoiler]. It's like these bond episodes have no regard for what's currently happening in the story. Talk about killing my immersion.\\n\\n[b]The most atrocious feature is target locking.[/b] After striking an enemy, the camera angle always moves to put your target on screen, so if you try to look away from them, the game moves your view back over to the enemy. This is so aggravating when you're trying to retreat because your health is low, but it you end up doing a 180 and sprinting back at the enemy. I couldn't find any settings that disabled this.\\n\\nAlso why is Yuito constantly being put in charge of his platoon? We constantly get reminded that Yuito is a recruit but Gamma, who is 50 years old, still in active duty, and \\\"knows nothing outside of fighting Others\\\" is also put under Yuito's command. Gamma does not contest this either. It feels like it has no other purpose than to make the player feel more important.\\n\\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\\nWell written characters, world immersion, and a non-buggy experience are the 3 most important aspects to a story-based game for me, and this title only checks 1 of those boxes. If the action and adventure are more important to you, you might really enjoy the epic and slightly repetitive fights. OST is good too. But I can't handle this game anymore; I want to beat the characters, including the MC, whenever they react stupidly to dire situations.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.7348744452274756, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"7/10\\n\\nTL;DR\\nA cyberpunk-ish RPG story with great visuals and animation, it's a game I would recommend for people who just wants to play RPG casually without having to waste their time grinding just to make story progression easier. The story is good but lacks in-depth exploration to some part of its lore (maybe intentional? are they going to release a part 2? or DLC?),  it's linear although it requires you to play through the 2 main protagonists to get the full picture.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nPlayed this game in a \\\"normal\\\" difficulty and progressed the story through the 2 main protagonists \\\"simultaneously\\\" at each phase (which my friend recommended), which I really think the best way to play this game to be able to get the full picture of the story and without having to play NG+.\\n\\nStory:\\n> What I like about the story is how it was pretty much straight forward to its world building with the mix of cyberpunk-ish theme and time travelling. Also, good VA performance and animation.\\n\\n> What the story lacks is that some explanations are shallow and seems not to be very interesting (lacks impact) as you'd expect it to be, as I would like to give an example I don't want to put any spoilers here. Although some of them might be intentional for them to expand further thru DLCs? But whatever the reason is, I guess it might have helped not to make the story too draggy.\\n\\n\\nBattle:\\nYou can only use the main character set for the story and the other party members will be AI-controlled BUT you can use their skills via SAS and also there are automated events (eg: blocking attacks) and combo visions to make the battle more dynamic and engaging.\\n\\nWhat I like:\\n> I liked the fast-paced battle without having to worry about mana-like mechanics, you can go full-offensive as you'd like thru normal attacks and mix-up w/ psychokinesis from time to time, also perfect dodge mechanic isn't bad nor perfect and it's quite easy to dodge during your mid-attacks as long you can predict or read the enemy's movement.\\n> Leveling is not a grind, just use the EXP assist plug-in and you're good to go.\\n\\nWhat I don't like:\\n> Camera lock-on on battles isn't polish and there are certain battles where it is annoying and part of it is that there's no incoming attack-indicator, so it's hard to do combos when there are a lot of enemies around you.\\n\\n---\\n\\nOverall, I don't think this game will grab everyone's attention because it lacks flashy animations but the battle mechanics is unique on its own way, it does have good story but it does lack some impact to some part of it, if a sequel will be released I'l still definitely play it.\\n\\nI would recommend this game for people who are looking for RPGs with good story, casual (linear) pace, and not worrying about level grind.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.06063309172712598, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"good game\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.05570668676706614, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Gameplay is very satisfying\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.05468847920580629, \"joke\": 1, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Funny surfing\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.03985155416737373, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Awesome game.

The dialogue, story, plot, all the stuff that is just \\\"putting words into a script\\\", is hilariously bad, make a drinking game of it with mates type bad. \\n\\nEverything else is really fun and good. The combat, the music, the map designs, even little details you won't notice till it's pointed out will have you going DAMN this game is BEAUTIFUL and actually well thought out. It's even kinda challenging with it's combat but the variety of fighting styles and how satisfyingly it all interconnects, yes, 8/10, solid. It's just a shame it's attached to the writing. \\nWhat would improve the combat is forgo the dual protagonist stuff and develop the other characters more. Your party members really don't add anything beyond being the source of your abilities. You can tag team and do combos whether you have them out or not. There's a lot of \\\"I trust you\\\" said when we use their powers but it's never really depicted as it being something dependent on our Bond, despite the level upgrades, it's more of a \\\"You signed the contract with me, now I use you anytime I want.\\\" Being gated when using characters and them telling you when to use\\nAlso, could use more environmental interactions. It feels like they discovered they could make you surf on a bus 3 chapters in and included that gimmick in each chapter after but not much really new, or anything to go back to earlier chapters for. (Always ride the bus. It is the best fun of the game.)\\n\\nAlso the item system... unlocking new items every chapter and having a weird half baked craft system is odd. It feels tacked on yet underdeveloped. The lack of filters and easy switching between what ingredients you need and where to find them makes trekking through the UI a slog and not worth the bother for a whole 3 more damage. It's definitely a lot more focused on it's cosmetics section. You can only own one of each so why even still list it in the shop? Why not filter for objects we can't make? Why even hide items chapter by chapter when it's gated by enemy drops anyway? Lots of things that make me think this system was implemented out of some 'the kids like this sorta thing' as opposed to on purpose.\\n\\nYour tutorial character/Operator will never stop shouting, 32 hours in, \\\"WAS THAT OIL!??\\\" \\\"Fire burns and is bad so don't get hit!\\\" \\\"I heard some water, it's hard to move when you're wet!\\\" and other generic things. The game is rated 16 because there are some heavy topics in here regarding child soldiers and the horrors of war. But it approaches the players with the respect you reserve for your 3 year old niece. You cannot toggle the tutorial dialogue, it will show up multiple times IN THE SAME FIGHT. It's insulting and downright arrogant. The combat is brilliant but by no means original. We've all seen 'use oil and then fire for extra damage' or 'water+electricity' yet the game shouts it at you like you've never seen it before. I honestly wonder if the Operators are bugged and Bandai were too proud to fix it.\\n\\n\\\"Bond Episodes\\\", this games version of Fire Emblem bonds or any dating sim elements really, are.. jarring with their tonal shifts and the painfully bad writing. Each character is a trope you've seen in multiple shows and their depth doesn't go beyond that. I especially love how every Bond Episode/Date is ended with our characters sharing the best of dialogue friends share: \\\"I think I know you a bit better now, Protag.\\\" \\\"Yes, I agree I think I also know you a bit better now, Side Character 7\\\". Every Date. Ends with. \\\"You are X/We are Y?\\\" \\\"No, you are the X/Of course we are Y\\\". It is so repetitive and every character does this, like they were literally ticking boxes, removing any attempt at uniqueness between your party members. \\n\\nBecause of the way the game is paced; Phase X, Mid-Phase X Story, with a mid-phase between each chapter specifically for dating and grinding, you especially notice how bad the dates are because none of this dialogue happens during Main chapters. Main chapters are for \\\"Looking at headless bodies can have negative lasting effects on your mental health\\\" and other stellar bits of P.L.O.T. intermixed with \\\"WAS THAT OIL!!??\\\" and very rare throwaway lines about the story so far that don't really say much. \\n\\nMid-Chapters are explicitly for you to talk to characters and farm any items you want. So of course every mid chapter starts with EVERY character lovebombing you asking for a date and sending you real time messages and texts all at the exact same time, like they're physically queued up at your mailbox. While I understand wanting to not effect the main story pacing (LOL) with what are some odd Bond Episodes, this format just lends itself to even more weirdness, where it seems like the moment you're back from the last traumatic story beat, you're straight into \\\"OMG I got us tickets gurl let's go to the game! BTW I'm depressed teehee\\\" and \\\"Yeah let's go on a date!! You remind me of my daughter btw\\\". It's literally this jarring. It's bad. It feels like the bonds were written completely independently of the main story so that there wouldn't be any potential overlap. The characters exist but the Bonds have no impact on the Main Story. \\n\\nThe Bonds and Story will not effect the lines shouted mid combat or while you're travelling. Yes we have been in the same party a long time. Please stop repeating that line. Yes your power does work well with mine, no I won't put you in the main group again, shut up, for the love of god. Each character has their \\\"We spend a lot of time together\\\", their \\\"I think you should use my power\\\" and their \\\"Nice job Protag!\\\" variations. It's so transparent and copy&paste I wonder if they had an AI write them.\\nA great example of this in particular is the Mom character Kyoka. Her classmate, Arashi, warns us about \\\"Kyoka's beast mode\\\". Even Kyoka knows of this. Her Super Serious Kill All Enemies Mode. Which, I love as a trope. It's stupid and I love it and I wanted to see it. But we never do. One plot part has it and then it's forgotten again. It's supposed to kick in anytime she's in combat but she's literally still sunshine and lollipops. I think she gets a bit more aggressive in her 'do the finishing blow!' line but maybe I'm on that copium. It's just a real shame. Every character falls short of their character design in this way, one way or another. Even Arashi, who could have interesting depth being a lower rank than her younger brother, but being a hacking prodigy from the Spring Pharmaceuticals family is just reduced to. Me lazy. Me make you do stuff. Gotta save my calories.\\n\\nSpeaking of line delivery... The Dubs are passable, but they aren't good. They're doing as expected for something with this bad writing but I get annoyed with Kasane's delivery the most. Her contrast from 'robotic demeanor unless Naomi or in Brain Field' is done so so badly. In the Brain field she clearly is meant to sound psychotic from the dialogue itself, the whole ultimate power yaddayadda. The voice actor makes it sound like she struck a homerun and saved the team. I hate it, it's really disappointing. Tsugumi's stutter sounds forced and unnatural, like she's reading the ellipsis and waiting to speak as opposed to struggling to push the words out. Kagero doesn't know when to sound aggressive or flirty (but you want neither he's an awful character).\\n\\nThe general pacing of the side character lines, the operator lines and the plot is all horrible. Also god the plot is like all the worst endings of shonen slammed into one. Like you can tell they were told to wrap up in 5 chapters so suddenly we have the most random crap shoehorned in and more relevant plot points dropped and whole characters disappeared even. None of which even phases your protag. My favourite line from Yuito, the male protag is \\\"I'm sure you all have questions. Even I don't know what's going on\\\".

Using different abilities depending on the combat situation and what members you have active with you is also an aspect of the game I can appreciate a lot.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.33595381690689846, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"The battle mechanism is so cool!

Story is pretty good, and the devs did their best to create a good story with no plot holes (as far as I can tell, which is pretty impressive considering the theme of the game). I really like how choosing your main characters actually mattered here. There is a main storyline, but which MC you choose to play with will give you more context on their side of the story. To get both sides, you'll need to play the other MC (I am planning to start Kasane's later on). I enjoy anime tropes, so although some people may find some characters cliche, I quite liked the characters in Scarlet Nexus (I hated Shiden at first, but he grew on me eventually). There are some characters that I really grew to love, like Hanabi, Tsugumi, and Gemma. What really made me stay and finish the game, though, was the combat. It's not 100% perfect, but it have always made me feel very engaged in the fight. With the SAS system, I always needed to think about which SAS to use depending on the situation. I feel like there are no useless abilities too. Everything happens very quickly, and I really enjoy that type of combat.\\n\\nSo, if that is your type of game, you should probably try Scarlet Nexus. I really enjoyed it and I would probably give it a 9/10. The only bad things being: 1) Camera angles not being the best (I prefer it to be further away), 2) A little grindy to get weapons, presents, etc., 3) Time-consuming to find side-quests.\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.0041570234418295314, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Very fun game but it takes sometime to get good story wise the combat is fast paced the best parts are the boss fights\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.017823909363330327, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"I'm almost done with Yuito's route, then afterwards, I will be going on to do Kasane.

If you like time travel, stupid unmotivated and unreasonable decisions without any real arguments then probably you will like it. In the end the game will not answer many questions you eventually will have and don't even tried to explain some stupid events. (BTW anime is shit, they even tried to repair their flaws from the game, but the result became even worse than the actual game.)\\n\\nBeautiful visual parts like cut-scenes, skills animations, locations and lots of skins for characters(but most of them just set with different colors). \\n\\nVery nice OST, especially if you are an anime fan.\\n\\nCompanion stories are good and deep, especially after finishing them with 2 characters because they show different sides of them. No love story, despite on some hint from some characters.\\n\\nPointless storytelling where you will beat the same enemies and like in bad anime they will just flee away to fight you again. Some people can survive meteor shower and others die just from 1 hit - wtf.\\n\\nMain character can fight with some dudes for most parts of the game, suffer from their decisions and then just go for a walk and have fun with them while the world is dying.\\n\\nGameplay at first is very interesting but then you realize that it will be the same for the rest of the game. Same limited moves and special skills - all difference is which sub characters you have in the party. Nearly same weapons and modules.\\n\\nNo builds for your main characters. All progression is straight forward - farm level, pick new talent and passives until you open them all. You don\\u2019t have to choose within some variant all limitations consider your active party members and modules which affect the game very little. Weapons and modules most of the time have so little difference, you choose a few variants and just wait when the upgraded version will become available. So you have 2 different main characters but for 80% they are the same, just different weapons and their move set.\\n\\nTotally useless exploration of the world, after beating the level by story all spots will have common items that you can have from regular mobs. No unique or rare equipment. All items for upgrades you can just farm from the training room where you can fight infinitely.  \\n\\nFor NG+ you need to beat the game 2 times with 2 main characters and this is nice because they show the story from different sides in the same timeline. But after that, playing for the 3d time only if you want 100% achievements - you can find final weapon and skins for every character and fight some previous enemies in the training room - that's all you got, nothing new like secret bosses or side quests.\\n\\nAll side quest are just challenges where you need to kill mobs in some special way or farm some items. No lore or interesting story comes with it. Side characters stories are all you have. \\n\\nStupid and boring grind of items to unlock new gifts for your side characters or upgrades to your weapons. There are no interesting craft system, like most jrpg have, in which you can find several really different weapons and try to upgrade them or combine for a better effect. Here you just wait to open a new type of enemy, then farm materials from them and new weapons will have a little bonus to your dmg.

From the first second you start it up, you can tell that the people who made this game had a lot of fun doing it. The core gameplay loop is a real-time action hack-and-slash, and the game feel it brings to the table is simply sublime. I can't properly describe the satisfying feeling of the combat because there just isn't anything else quite like it, but a close comparison is NieR: Automata or Tales of Arise. Alongside the combat is a companion friendship system akin to Persona, or again, Tales of Arise. Some characters are annoying and have character traits they don't really get over, but others are incredibly endearing and show tremendous growth throughout the story's progression. Each of them falls loosely into a tropey personality type, but the way they're handled makes them feel believable anyway. (mostly.)\\n\\nAs for the plot... it's complicated. It's complicated to explain, complicated to give an opinion on, and extremely complicated to sit through. It does make sense, every little bit of what happens follows the game's internal logic and has an explanation, but none of those explanations are shoved in your face, and some them just amount to characters doing or not doing something depending on who they are. It took me 5 full playthroughs to completely understand all of what's going on from both perspectives - that's not as much of a time investment as you might think, you can absolutely blitz through the game on repeat playthroughs because your acquired items and relationship levels with characters persist through newgame+. The game expects and wants you to play it multiple times, in fact, you can't even really \\\"finish\\\" it without playing the entire thing at least twice, once as each of the two playable characters.\\n\\nBack to the combat. It's simple, yet it doesn't lack depth and encourages experimentation. Each character in this game has a superpower they use to fight with. Both playable character have telekinesis they use to throw sh\\u2665t around, and others range from anything as simply as adding fire effects to their attacks, to complicated powers like \\\"Clairevoyance\\\" which allows them to see and understand things others simply can't. The main gimmick of the combat system is that instead of each of these characters fighting individually, you can add their powers to yours to use two at once. So not only can you throw sh\\u2665t around and whip your sword through the air like it's a f\\u2665cking boomerang, but you can also light it on fire, or make things you throw around burst into flames too, or you can add that Clairevoyance effect to make dodging and counterattacking way easier and more beneficial, reveal invisible enemies and more easily expose their weakpoints, so on and so forth. But it doesn't stop there. When you get enough skills unlocked, you can start stacking up to four of these powers together all at once, and become a god. Combine Flames for more attack power, Clairevoyance for more deadly counterattacks, Stone Skin to literally make yourself invincible, and a power that clones you, thus tripling every hit you deal, and watch as enemies simply stop existing in your presence.\\n\\nThere are 8 of these supplemental powers, all of which you can mix and match together for different complicated effects in combat, and they all interact with your attacks differently depending on which main character you're playing as. So while it's not super complicated, the combat system is in-depth enough and allows for enough different playstyles at any given moment to keep every fight feeling fresh for multiple entire playthroughs, on any difficulty level. If that type of combat and a story you'll really need to dig into to understand sound like something you'd be interested in, then by all means give this game a try.\\n\\n[h1]And don't forget, it has a demo.[/h1]\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.038406389596135466, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Negative\", \"review_text\": \"I didn't want to give this a bad review but a serious repeating bug won't let me get past the tutorial.\\n\\nThe controls refuse to register switching targeting no matter what I press.\\n\\nLooked like a good game but it's impossible to play past this one point and it doesn't look like it will be fixed.\\n\\nDoesn't matter if it's a PC or Steam deck, same bug happens.\\n\\n\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.05519264193829565, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Actually this like is for only Opening Vid.

Well this is a game that I had been putting off for awhile now and had been interested in it ever since it's original announcement, but I also just assumed that it would possibly be another random write off game by bandai because some of the games they make seem to be licensed games for different animes that they pump out, but wow.... This game is not that. This is probably one of my favorite original new IP's from bandai namco in a very very long time. I have just now finished the first playthrough with Kasane and looking to do my next playthrough with Yuito in new game+. The story in this game is amazing the music is also really good. This game is probably not going to be for everyone due to it's weird genre, but if it looks interesting to you then please don't put it off like I have. This has to be one of my most recent hidden gems having played this year my biggest regret is having not played it sooner when I had known about it for awhile and had it on my ever growing list of steam games that I have yet to play. The story has two unfolding narratives and unlike most games this isn't a gimmick the story feels very worth playing for both sides and honestly I don't feel like their is a right and wrong character to start with. The combat starts out pretty fun, but gets even better the more you level up and unlock. This game currently probably is one of my favorite series in recent memory, and I am all in on this series now and will definitely buy a sequel game if they make one, but without spoiling to much I hope they continue from the existing characters because I love them so much bandai. q-q\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.030483496390157454, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"A unique and fresh take on the JRPG scene.

The gameplay is really fun, fast-paced, flashy, and the system to use powers is pretty unique.

It's nice to get a little backstory on some characters, and these do a good job on developing some relationships (although some are no more deep than your standard \\\"tsundere admits you're a cool dude\\\"). This is all well and good, but it can take up a significant amount of your total playthrough. You can skip the cutscenes, so it could be worse, but there are certain cutscenes which can't be skipped that make the process a bit more tedious (e.g. giving someone a gift plays a 30 second long animation for them to say some variant of \\\"thanks\\\" with a black screen transition to and from this scene). \\n\\nA heavy element of this game's marketing was that you can play as one of two characters, a guy whose melee is stronger than his psychokinesis, and a girl who is the opposite. Their stories deviate at a few key moments, but towards the final 1/3rd of the game, they reconvene and tell each other what happened in their deviations.

Additionally, almost all of the cutscenes are in a \\\"freeze frame with dialogue over it\\\" style, which is a little disappointing personally.\\n\\nThe sound design and soundtrack are both great, nothing too exciting to add there.\\n\\nAll in all, it's a good anime action RPG with a middling visual novel attached.

Art design is beautiful and definitely surpasses the level design. Performance wise i cant say much, playing on an RX6800XT in 4k maxed settings works fine for over 120fps but thats to be expected.\\n\\nSound: The OST is pretty good but nothing that stands out. Some of the somber tracks really work well to set the scene though.\\n\\nLevels: The levels are simple corridors with some branching side areas where enemy spawns and bonus loot are. Nothing special, nothing to praise, gameplay wise the most exiting level has you running around looking for keycards. Overall Sub-Par.\\n\\nGameplay: This is clearly where most of the budget went and it works really well but it also comes with flaws. Like almost every japanese game for some reason you will be bombarded with tutorials at the start of the game introducing every of the billion mechanics this game has to offer right off the bat. No one will remember all that and its straight up annoying. I dont know why basically every japanese game does that but i digress. Since nearly all mechanics are handed to the player straight outta the gate there is not much progression throughout the game. It takes a long while to warm up to the combat and it only really starts to shine in the last third of the game where the entire squad is available to you, prior to that you are very handicapped.\\nCombat is very flashy and fast paced but this leads you to be locked into animations, a lot of enemies have extremely quick wind ups causing you to take unnecessary hits. It would have been better if they allowed animation cancelling similar to what the DMC games do or tone the combat down to be closer to a Souls game. \\nBalancing is alright. Enemies tend to be very spongy and tedious to fight but once you warmed up to the mechanics and get your combos rolling its absolutely managable.\\nOverall the combat itself is very fun but its dragged down a notch by the other gameplay issues.\\n\\nStory: At first i thought they skimped on the budged but later i could see why they skimped on the budget here. Vast majority of dialogues is told in a visual-novel style format and only rarely are animations used, thats because it would completely blast the budget to animate all of the billion dialogue lines, seriously there is so much dialogue its basically half the game if you wanna listen to everything.\\nThe story itself is very enjoyable, i had a great time. They do a lot of foreshadowing and callbacks to previous events which ties up a lot of loose ends and prevents random plot devices for the most part. The consistency of the story suffers a little when it comes to the time travel aspect but other than that its extremely nicely written.\\nI played with Japanese voices and english subtitles. The translations were very odd at some points. A lot of times the choice of words was just wrong or off-putting. Not a major problem, more a personal gripe of mine.\\nOverall i think the story is really really good.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nI think Scarlet Nexus is a very enjoyable game that provides the player both their time and money's worth and i do definitely recommend it.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.03780536123103263, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Negative\", \"review_text\": \"boring\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.020212338353472754, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Great combat system with rich story, highly recommended.\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.052431890081971674, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"The game plays out like an old rpg but with a nice action combat system and it looks decent is my impression of it.\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.04555393123555363, \"joke\": 1, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Great satisfying combat and the story just keeps on getting better and bettter.\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.05493535275876874, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Negative\", \"review_text\": \"I liked the game at the start, but after a while it got very repetetive and boring.

There are some nice things about it but it feels like some of the combat was left like an afterthought, with the game moving in so many weird directions that I don't even think they were sure what they were trying to make. They try to sound edgy with all the weird terminology/jargon that is involved in their world that it kind of gets on the nerves after a bit.\\n\\nSo, about the combat, it is super repetitive and janky. You are so hard animation locked on your basic atk spam that it's a joke. Bosses can aimbot you with their ranged attacks, for example there will be one boss that kind of has a faucet face and shoots water at you from there, as you run around and try to evade it, the boss's model spins in place to always be facing you without even moving its legs to indicate movement, and unless you are either far enough away for the water to not reach you or you Iframe it, it will always hit you, you cannot just dash to the side and move before it launched, you are locked on hard.\\n\\nThere is another boss soon after that, a hairy weird thing with an oil tank on its back that is a weak spot. The boss's model is so damn janky that sometimes when you use your telekinesis to throw objects at it, it will not register as a weakpoint hit but a regular, negligible damage body. On top of that, you may also try to jump atk the oil tank which can be done, but the stupid ass boss model or hitbox is so damn badly done that from some angles you will not even do damage to anything even though you see your weapon clearly hot not just the oil tank but the boss's body itself.\\n\\nThis feels like a game that is borderline a prime example of \\\"all show and no substance\\\" where the game visually looks nice and there's some flashiness appeal, but what's under the hood is inconsistent and messy. Only the ideas the game proposes are interesting, but not the execution.\\n\\nI'm not even sure I want to keep playing but I'm leaving it installed for now and hope something changes with it and gets better after trying to trudge through this story.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.029155483558738073, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"its gud\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.37353819981369396, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"This game was a fairly enjoyable experience.

Tutorials will interrupt you as well until just about the end of the game. Your squad mates will always remind you how to play the game too, which becomes annoying quick. Despite that, I do love the characters and the bonding missions you can do with them. Their aid in combat really enhances the fluidity of fighting.

I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I picked this game up on a whim but, boy oh boy, was it one helluva ride. This game is part action RPG, part visual novel, all style. Let's break down the pros and cons of Scarlet Nexus one by one.\\n\\n[b]Cons[/b]\\n\\n1. The side quests are very uninspired. None of them have any story and they all have the same tiring objective of \\\"kill X number of Y monsters using Z method\\\".\\n2. There's not much in the way of interactions with the world and NPCs beyond picking up the occasional side quest.\\n3. The game has a somewhat confusing pricing model. Without writing a long-winded essay on crappy corporate practices, the important thing to note is if you bought the Ultimate Edition, you'll get all content. Conversely, if you bought the Deluxe Edition + the Season Pass, you'll also have all content.\\n4. The weapon upgrade system is pretty barebones and the actual weapons are kinda meh.\\n5. I wish you could manually make a NG+ save any time you want after the game ends. The current \\\"one save only as soon as the game ends\\\" model is super limiting.\\n6. I hate seeing that stupid Photo Mode prompt all the time lmao.\\n\\n[b]Pros[/b]\\n\\n1. Beautiful, crisp anime art style.\\n2. A compelling story with layers upon layers of intrigue. I almost wish it was EVEN more whack/sinister but nonetheless I was thoroughly invested from beginning to end.\\n3. The cast is fantastic with especially the EX bond episodes being a highlight.\\n4. The music is sooooooooo good. The OST was an instant buy for me.\\n5. Combat is both challenging and fun. Using the right character's powers at the right moment in the right way is super satisfying and requires a good deal of knowledge and skill.\\n6. The monster and character design is awesome. Highly memorable and distinctive.\\n7. Playing through the game again with a different character is very rewarding. You'll see a new perspective in the story and have totally unique interactions with your party members.\\n8. The dialogue is extensive, well-written and engaging. The voice acting (I used Japanese) is also excellent.\\n\\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\\n\\nI was unsure if Scarlet Nexus was worth playing as I didn't really get what it was about from the trailers but after giving it a chance and playing for over 80 hours, I can confidently say that this game is FANTASTIC.

Having only completed Yuito's playthru, I'll prob give Kasane's a quick run before I decide on whether or not to just YouTube the cutscenes.\\n\\nThe visual design of this game is stunning, the cast is written well enough, the soundtrack is pretty good, the combat feels great and enemy design is varied enough to not get stale.

I played using Kasane, and whenever I engage in combat, it is not possible to dodge until she finishes with her moves, leaving me vulnerable to enemies' attacks. Plus, once I was down or knocked to the ground, she got up really slowly. Mashing my keyboard button won't do anything. Unless I spend the point to get the skill to get up immediately once I get knocked down.\\n\\n[h1] CONTROL [/h1]\\n\\nSince I play this game using a mouse and keyboard, the experience was good. However, for some things like SAS, which has the same layout as the controller, it is a bit difficult (don't have trouble if you already memorised the keyboard mapping). 1 for the [b] top [/b] SAS, 2 for the [b] left [/b] SAS. That's my key map. Of course, you can change it to suit your playstyle. For this game, I think a controller is suitable.\\n\\n[h1] GRAPHICS [/h1]\\n\\nThe graphics look pretty good since it is made with Unreal Engine 4. The details of the textures, characters, etc. are really nice.\\n\\n[h1] SOUND [/h1]\\n\\nEach area or place has its own BGM, including battle mode and idle mode. However, the most important for me is the BGM when fighting a boss. It is not EPIC (my personal opinion), but the BGM is still there.\\n\\n[h1] STORY [/h1]\\n\\nIt reminds me of certain games like Nier: Automata, where you can experience each character's story. When starting the game, you can choose which character you want to play as. Each character has their own plot. To experience and understand the story, players should play the game twice by playing a different character in the New Game+. There is one character that I don't really enjoy playing, which is Kasane. Her personality looks pretty boring and static. She is so serious, and if she makes a joke, I don't think she can beat Mr. Lo Wang from the Shadow Warrior game when it comes to that. The game can be beaten in 25 hours according to [url=https://howlongtobeat.com/game/77921] HowLongToBeat [/url] if you only concentrate on the main story. But for me as a completionist, expect double or triple the time to complete it.\\n\\n[h1] CONCLUSION [/h1]\\n\\nYou should try this game if you are into sci-fi RPGs. The game is well optimised. There is no frame rate limit of 60 frames per second. Even with my GTX 1650, I can experience smooth gameplay at high graphics settings, without motion blur (come on, turn that setting off!).

Its got a uniquely amazing story and rarely does a game even come close to making me feel as epic as this one did. The only thing I really have to say negatively is the world is pretty empty, side quests are kinda pointless, and there is a lot of repetitive arenas, but those are really not that big of a deal honestly. This is a truly amazing game that shouldn't be over looked.\\n\\nLonger: This game does a lot right. I think it has a unique universe and an interesting story with a lot of (skip-able) fluff. The combat takes a little to get used to and you CERTAINLY need to level up a few times and get upgrades before it starts to feel really good. That said, by the end of the game, the combat flows so unbelievably well. I feel like a God yet the game isn't too easy. I feel like a hero and a true team leader especially in the end; I get really invested and immersed in the game because the combat is so good. Yuito's base 4 partners and Kasane's base 4 partners flow independently really well and together really well when you get to that point in the game. I honestly don't feel overwhelmed with the controls when I am managing 8/10 abilities on top of my own entire and large library of moves and attacks. \\n\\nSpeaking of library of attacks, both Kasane and Yuito are balanced well (though I do think Kasane takes the edge especially when you are playing as Yuito fighting Kasane vs playing as Kasane fighting Yuitio) having unique and fairly evenly powered skills. The game is really worth playing both times. It does such a perfect time of being similar so that when you play the second time you are still overall improving using character abilities while still being a different experience story wise and gameplay wise. \\n\\nOutside of the fantastic game play the story is enjoyably good too. Most of the characters are enjoyable, FUCK SHIDEN. Me and all the homies hate Shiden. They have cute and fun bond missions that you can skip if you don't care while still providing an actual effect in game. Both Kasane and Yuito have interesting sides of the same story and its worth playing a second time to see what the other protagonist's version of events was to understand the game. The characters each have full stories and fairly unique powers bringing nice variation to the game. The only real downside to the story comes from the empty environment. It can sometimes ruin the immersion and lead to some lackluster parts of the game. In my opinion though, its not that terrible and does not take away from the game too much. \\n\\nMy genuine biggest complaint is that the 'quick get up from attack' ability you have to unlock.

I found the AI to be really dumb compared to the other games. My actual team on the map didn't do much usually, and the enemy AI just spammed 3 moves...excessively. And that is the other thing I really am less than impressed with. There really wasn't many types of enemies. I don't even think there was more than 15 models. It was just them renamed with a different gimmick to kill them. So by the end I was so bored of killing them, I could barely stand it.\\n\\nThe gear system was like GodEater super lite, so it was boring there too. The mods you can put on yourself were kind of a waste of time too because I had to put a mod on just to stop every attack from being canceled by enemy attacks and there is only 3. There was no block, only a weird 2 button dodge that I just don't understand. A double tap would have been better with some way to block and counter. \\n\\nThe story was like a sci-fi grab bag with A HUGE emphasis on relationship building. I spent about 8 hours watching cut scenes just to get better powers in a 35 hour play-through. Any attachment I was supposed to have to them was negated from the grind of it. Then there is the crazy message system.  About 3/4s of them are just them telling you in a message what they already said in person. I really don't understand that. Plus, there really wasn't that many maps and I was less than happy with the final dungeon. It was just pieces of them all mashed together with the most annoying enemies spawned over and over and over and over and over. I was so happy to just get to the end to finish the misery of it.\\n\\nIt just felt rushed and just not as good as some of the other games as far as the maps, systems, and story go. I know Tales of Arise probably ruined me since it is their flagship JRPG franchise and the systems are super polished by the time you get to Arise, but still, they could have done better here.

Visually, it's impressive, the \\\"brain punk\\\" concepts in the story are unique, and the combat system is visually stunning, responsive, and occasionally challenging.\\n\\nThat said, the gameplay is rote repetition.  You only have a handful of specific abilities available throughout the bulk of the game, and the task isn't to come up with sweet original combos for a high score like you might in Devil May Cry - rather it's to identify the specific ability that will let you trivialize each type of opponent and apply those abilities one by one while dodging attacks from all angles.  This makes the combat feel less like battle and more like a pattern recognition puzzle.\\n\\nThe narrative also overstays its welcome, in the sense that the overly complex main plot spends so much of its word count just explaining the basics of what's going on that there's no time left to develop any character except for the two protagonists.  The development of secondary characters is instead shoehorned into \\\"very special episode\\\" style one-on-one conversations between missions, which means you spend a long time consecutively watching minimally-animated cutscenes - I want to say I spent an hour or two in one sitting on some of the later intermissions.  You can't skip these either, as they're necessary to increase the effectiveness of your abilities in combat.\\n\\nMy overall sense of the game is that the combat could have been a lot more nuanced and a lot more flexible, while the story and intermissions could have been greatly streamlined without losing anything of value.

The game has a feature where you can cue up commands to avoid time lag between attacks so you can press X to attack and, while the attack animation is playing out, you can hit X again to immediately move into the next animation with no time lag when the previous animation ends. The only issue that I have with this is that there doesn't feel like there is much of a priority filter built in. For instance, you have an attack command in cue but cannot override it with a dodge command when you anticipate an enemy attack incoming. At least, this is how it felt to me.\\nAnyway, despite my gripes with the combat system, I still have a lot of fun playing. Like I said, great game. Money well spent.

It was pleasant but still challenged me to continue at times with a water puddle of a story, but has such engaging combat and characters it kept me going through both playthroughs.\\n\\nThe gameplay is pretty simple but evolves with the skill tree. The combat gets interesting with the SAS system where you borrow powers from your friends to make unique combinations for devastating attacks depending on the enemy you face, who are all different and require unique tactics against. To be honest, some enemies were bullshit with stun attacks and AOEs, especially when they get together and gank you, but that's where the simple git gud comes in to overcome such challenges. Tho it could get very repetitive sometimes. The enemies' designs were also horrifying and cool.\\n\\nThe game is set up with 2 campaigns/playthroughs with our 2 protagonists. Both have their unique playstyles whose stories intertwine, but their stories are made differently as Yuito is left in the dark for much of the story as something akin to a question arc while Kasane gets her revelations a lot faster and works as more of an answer arc. So I'd recommend playing as Yuito and if you like the game enough, Kasane. The story was very whatever, both the plot and pacing were very serviceable, but it's saved by an amazing cast of unique characters. The cast is elevated even more with the bond system which works by doing bond episodes where you spend time with the supporting characters individually and uncover their quirks and challenges they face which I found very therapeutic. You also increase your bond by giving them gifts which begin to shape the hideout which adds to the personality of the cast.\\n\\nThe music is very praiseworthy. All the girls were waifu-tier. Didn't bother with side quests as they were all fetch-quests with whatever rewards. I appreciate Bandai is still making games with anime aesthetic, that shit is my bread and butter, please don't ever change that.\\n\\nAnd god bless Kyoka's perfect ample bosom, Tsugumi's lustrous lips and Hanabi's delicious tummy ooooooooo \\ud83d\\ude2d\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.029943689388687134, \"joke\": 1, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"i just really like the game mechanics and the mysteries that needs a bit of thinking in the story\\n\\nand that's all\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.06253601186807935, \"joke\": 1, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Great story and really fun combat system.\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.04326744298510035, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Cute but psycho\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.10630834393152798, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Negative\", \"review_text\": \"Why have a main antagonist when everyone is defeated by friendship, and everyone is your friend in the end no matter what kind of atrocities were committed.

It also has quite a unique story as you get to play from the perspective of two different characters: Yuito and Kasane. The combat in this game is also highly addictive and fun and continues getting more advanced the further you make it into the story. Some of the downsides are there is no romantic options when it comes to relationship building in the game but it is implied.

Humanity has developed into a race of psionics, with almost everyone having some form of psychic ability. Those with the most power are scouted by the OSF, the Other Suppression Force, to fight these monsters. Those who are especially popular are constantly hounded by the press...but isn't it a little weird that there are just so many cameras around town? It's probably nothing. \\n\\n\\n[h1]What Worked For Me[/h1]\\n[b]PK Funyun[/b]\\nFlinging shit around the arena and into enemies never got old. It would be nice if it did more damage, but you can even incorporate throwing boxes and so on into your regular weapon attacks, and there are even upgrades to let you extend how many times you can do normal attack -> PK -> normal chains! Using LT to manipulate big things or trigger the QTE sequences for extra damage or the like was actually pretty cool, too.\\n\\nBut I had the biggest grin in a couple of instances. I think it's in Phase 3, you're on an abandoned highway. There are vehicles strewn about, but there are also big buses with LT prompts. Triggering these had Yuito jump on top, the horn would honk, and you could actually steer the bus as it hurtled forward on its own, and you could kill Others this way! \\n\\nAnd then in...Phase 9? There were these big fences or something set up. And you could LT them and ride them like a flying carpet and mow down Others this way. And this happened again in the final area! That was the most stupid, ridiculous fun I had with the game, though regular PK use was still great, too! \\n\\n[b]A borrowed knife[/b]\\nThe SAS feature was actually really neat, too, but it gets pretty crazy when you get the Brain Map upgrades to let you stack two and later four at once. Even ignoring the silly abuse you can pull off by attacking with flaming blades with accompanying clones at hyperspeed while invisible, the game puts obstacles in your way where you have to use these powers. Like, when you're in the snowy mountain range, there are big blocks of ice where you have to use Hanabi's fire powers to destroy them, or when in some secret research facility, there are wire fences that you can teleport through. Sometimes you need to use powers during combat, like Clairvoyance when enemies go invisible or spit smoke to blind you, so that helps to keep fighting dynamic. \\n\\n[b]Photo Mode[/b]\\nEvery offline game needs a Photo Mode. I used to be someone who would take screenshots of interesting places, but the player character/other characters/the UI would get in the way. Photo Mode in this game still appends copyright info, but that it's a simple LB+Up command makes it pretty easy to use at any time, if slightly awkward if you're using it while moving. It's a little too bad you can't 'dive into' the photograph cutscenes considering the game still is rendering the environment in 3D, though. \\n\\n[b]Home[/b]\\nThe Hideout initially is pretty empty. There are furnishings, but it's pretty obvious it's unused. As you give Gifts to your allies, you start to see them on each person's little desk/personal space, and something that I thought was really cute was those allies having idle animations in the Hideout where they actually use those Gifts. Like, you can give Luka a pullup bar and later see him trying to pull himself up on it, or see people reading the books you give them, or Kagero being given a magician's outfit and trick set having him appear invisible while still having the clearly visible top hat 'floating' in the air...and when you talk to him, he reappears, takes the top hat off, taps the brim with a wand, and roses pop out of it. It kind of makes the Gifts seem less like trying to game the affection feature for bonuses and more like actually giving people nice things. \\n\\nYuito/Kasane also can receive Gifts from allies, and these will show up on their personal desk, too. \\n\\n[h1]What I Didn't Like[/h1]\\n[b]Uh...excuse me, what.[/b]\\nLook, I've played [i]Kingdom Hearts[/i] across several entries. I know where to turn off my brain when it comes to story bits that don't make sense or so on. There were some parts here where I had to do that. Like, Yuito willfully meeting people on the opposing team who are [i]trying to kill him[/i] and having friendly conversation. I know you meet in neutral territory, but it just seems extremely stupid. How does he know it's not a trap? Considering he goes alone and could even be ambushed...I don't know. It's one of those things that took me out of the game, and it's too bad too considering I liked other parts of the setting. \\n\\nThere were some 'too anime' moments too. Like, one of the final sequences where you go through the final boss'...er, five phases or something? [spoiler]Even after the big finish, somehow the boss is barely inconvenienced despite being 'finished off' with a several ton block crushing them.[/spoiler] It's just...yeah, okay, whatever.  \\n\\nI did have issue with how long the cutscenes ran (less so the ratio of gameplay vs story), mostly because I was under a strict time limit. But I didn't skip any cutscenes other than the time the game froze during one I saw already, so it was again a hell of my own design. \\n\\n[h1]Verdict - 5/5[/h1]\\nI really had fun with this one. I just wish I had started it a day earlier when it went on Free Weekend so I wouldn't 'have to' rush and do a horrible nine-hour sprint to actually finish the game before losing access to it forever. It's unfortunate I had crashing problems, but I'm not going to question having them stop when I went back to Borderless Windowed. \\n\\nThe big question is, am I going to buy this? I mean, I would eventually like to see the entirety of Kasane's side of the story, but I'm in no hurry. Even $15 on sale is kinda high, so I'll wait. So, the answer is 'yes, just not anytime soon'. I have other things to play in the meanwhile. \\n\\nThere's a demo. I never even tried it before, but it's there. It'll hopefully give you a general idea of how the game works, though if it's of the earliest part of the game, you won't have much opportunity to play around with the SAS gimmick.\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.24029197526400825, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"== Apologies for the messy structure.

The story is super long and dramatic, so it is best enjoyed at your own pace.\\nThe two characters' stories are different from what I've been informed, but I have only finished one of them so far.\\n\\n\\n------------------------\\nBefore you do anything, I think you should install the free demo for this game and try it for yourself. Since there is both a story demo and gameplay demo included, you can get a feel for the mid-game experience AND what the story is like. (To be honest, I thought I'd have to slog through level grinding in the full game in order to get to the point of the gameplay demo, but that wasn't the case at all. The early-game combat is still rather interesting, and if you love hack'n'slash games, you'll value the opportunity to learn the basic gameplay loops before you learn other skills/attacks. Other reviews mention a grind, and if that's a concern for you, just slap on the \\\"New Recruit Combat XP Boost\\\" and you'll get double XP. Thanks to it, I haven't experienced any grinding at all.) *See my update in regards to grind.\\n\\nThis game is awesome, but... its story is REALLY emotionally heavy. Maybe too much so. If you plan to get invested, prepare yourself! This game throws one emotional sucker punch after another at you. Find other lighthearted games or stories to enjoy on the side, because otherwise it might get you feeling depressed for a while.\\nThe story is also chock-full of subplots, to the point of being overbearing if you don't take breaks to process what's happened. I think seeing where those subplots converge and tie into the main story is half the fun, though. All in all, if you want to get totally immersed in this world and its band of characters/friends, you've got it right here. The best I can describe it is a tale of collective hardship, with themes of struggle and lessening the burden for each other with comradery and support.\\n\\nThe gameplay might speak to you if you're a frequent action game player. While it's technically a hack'n'slash in battle, it uses teammate abilities (dubbed the \\\"Struggle Arms System,\\\" SAS) in a manner similar to games like Tales of Arise (so I've heard). As a massive DMC addict, I welcomed these with open arms. One of my favorite aspects of Dante's gameplay in those games is his different fighting \\\"styles\\\" you can swap between on the fly. Swapping between this game's abilities is a bit similar to that, making you feel like a badass.\\nOutside of the core gameplay and the super-heavy story, this game also dabbles in a JRPG-like system with deepening bonds with your allies, and ties that directly into more powerful SAS variations. I'm totally new to this kind of system, but it wasn't as disengaging as I initially expected. Giving your allies gifts and engaging in the bonding quests provides both a nice break from the main story and a deeper look into the characters' lives. It's encouraging to see these child soldiers form supportive friendships to get through such traumatizing experiences.\\n\\nYou're probably going to have a lot of playtime with this game, considering both protagonists have their own storylines. I cannot confirm if the other reviews' claims of massive overlap are true or not, but I'll have to see. I'll be taking a long break to savor everything before I start on the other story.\\n\\nTo address the \\\"anime-game\\\" quirks: More than half of the game's cutscenes (at least in my playthrough) are still-image, with anime-like lipsync portraits representing the character's speech. I know that's not for everyone, but I enjoy the story enough for it to not be a problem. When you do have fully animated cutscenes, though, they go HARD. The few combat scenes are near-flawless, and you can tell that's where the cutscene budget went. Other than that, you get a lot of characters standing around like NPCs (including your allies), and repetitive voicelines, but if you like the gameplay & story enough these won't really get in the way of your enjoyment.\\n\\nI bought the game when it was on sale for $15 USD, but I think it's worth even $30. Not sure if it's worth the full asking price of $60 though.\\n\\nMAY 2023 UPDATE: I've come back to the game and finished Kasane's story. I finished the game in about 44 hours. The ending does not disappoint, I really liked it! Like some of the other bosses in the game, the final boss does some unique stuff that you wouldn't expect. My thoughts on the game are largely the same as from the original review. I still really enjoy this game despite the heavy themes and time-sink ally bond systems.\\nAs for the grind, the New Combat XP equipment helped me stay on pace through the story mode, with minimal grinding. I swapped it out for another utility during boss fights as to not have a dead slot.\\nI finished the game at level 64, and the final boss was level 70 on Playthrough 1. I have been informed that you need to defeat a level 99 secret boss in order to play the Karen DLC, so you may need to do lots of grinding after the main game if you bought said DLC. (Some players have suggested using the Health Preserve assist on that fight.)\\nMAY UPDATE 2: I've found an XP leveling guide that works even better with the XP booster item. If you enjoy replaying special missions for a high score/style ranking, that helps a little bit with leveling too.\\nJUNE UPDATE 1: The post-game and new game plus systems are rewarding in ways you wouldn't expect. This game still finds ways to surprise me (in a good way!)\\nJUNE UPDATE 2: Looking back at my older screenshots, there's actually a lot of attention to visual detail in this game that you wouldn't notice on your first playthrough, whether it be in the characters' clothing or environments. After knowing what this game has in store past the first playthrough, I think I'd buy it for $60.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.049656624470138175, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Lost my fucking mind at every plot twist and big reveal.

Having not watched the TV series in the same title, I wouldn't have touched this game if not for the limited free time to play and the fact that the protagonists look good. Scarlet Nexus has 2 story lanes and are related, I managed to finish Yuito - the boy's partial story just a few hours before the free event ends. Honestly I did not find the story very interesting nor the fight intriguing, however what kept me going was the characters look good and make cool poses.\\n\\nTo save time I stuck only with the main mission, didn't take time in side missions or in developing friendships with as many as 7 (or 8?) teammates. Most of the time JRPG gives me a feeling that people are na\\u00efve and can't see straight even if the truth is right in front. Scarlet Nexus occasionally makes me feel this way, however, at least it has a fairly good worldview, most of the time it feels authentic and there is no conflict in the setting, good thing is after completing Yuito's story I find both the storyline and timeline rigorous and acceptable.\\n\\nThe cutscenes are combined by animation and slides like comics. It's alright for me yet still I was confused - since the background is already made in 3D why not make it fully animated. The advantage is all the characters look great, facial expression is natural, goes well with the emotion and easy to take great photo snaps.\\n\\nAs for the battle, player proceed in a designed path and kill monsters along the way. About 50-50 you will be locked in a limited space to clear all or, can run away if not interested in a fight. The special kill with short anime looks amazing but watching it several times quickly made it plain, so are the hit feeling and combos, especially with highly repeated monsters and endless maze with annoying long corridors to run. There is not much to collect or upgrade either.\\n\\nNear the end the story was unexpected. Overall the price of 75% is okay, but I've finished the boy's part so I'll pass.

Let's break it down:\\n\\n[b] Story: Great [/b]\\nIt's what you'd expect from an anime action game; a world so cohesively crazy that you get hooked and immersed no matter how ridiculous it is. The characters take the spotlight while the setting serves as context to their motivations. You don't have to pay attention to what's happening (and with how often plot beats and twists happen, it's likely that you can't keep up anyway), but the chemistry between the cast, helped by their VA's performances, will keep you going through the game. I recommend playing Yuito's story for your first playthrough.\\n\\n[b] Graphics: Stellar [/b]\\nBy far my favorite aspect of the game. The artstyle blends industrial, sci-fi, and fantastical spaces into one to create a world with beauty and style. The nature-reclaimed Kunad Highway, the high-rise districts of Kikuchiba, and the cyber-oriental computer space of Arahabaki are among my favorite levels by their scenery and aesthetics alone. Every environment has it's own unique style and gimmick, complete with a wonderful soundtrack for each of them.\\n\\n[b] Gameplay: Serviceable [/b]\\nI'll be honest, I expected a little more in terms of gameplay. The basic combos you start with are neither stylish nor efficient, which is a bit disappointing for a game so flashy. Upgrades are hard to come by as you level up higher and higher, and even after completing both stories using a NG+ save, I still couldn't fully upgrade Yuito or Kasane.\\nLate-game enemies are annoying at least, with many of them being large, miniboss-like enemies with large health pools and fast attacks. They either have gimmicks that require you use a specific ability to knock them down, or are so tanky that they force you to fight on their terms. Multiple times. With at least two other enemies you also need to pay attention to. By far the biggest offenders are the \\\"Chinery\\\" and \\\"Santa\\\"-type enemies, who are fast and aggressive with attacks that interrupt or knock you down while at the same time refusing to be knocked down themselves.\\nIn terms of combat, it's a weird union of DMC and Souls-like. You are both encouraged and discouraged from committing to longer combos, seeing as you don't have the tools necessary to avoid an incoming attack while in the middle of a combo. The \\\"Perfect Dodge\\\" and \\\"Brain Drive/Brain Field\\\" systems are also poorly implemented. Perfect Dodge has a timing window too small to be practical, and options too limited to be effective. BD activates automatically with little noticeable effects, and BF is really only effective against common enemies in the early game; later bosses have tools that allow them to completely avoid your slow and clunky attacks in BF, making it almost useless during boss battles.\\nIt's not all bad though, the abilities and \\\"Combo Visions\\\" obtained through bonding with your squad offer a much needed extra layer of depth, and the \\\"Assault Visions\\\" reward your effectiveness in battle with strong finishing blows that can often finish off the enemy. If you're willing to master the game's systems, there are also missions accessible via the TV at the Hideout that test your effectiveness in combat, complete with a ranking system and rewards that offer further customization.\\n\\n[b] Final verdict: [u] Recommended [/u] [/b]\\nScarlet Nexus has a great cast, great soundtrack, great levels and environments, great art direction and \\\"good enough\\\" combat systems for a casual player. For a price tag of $40, it's up to your discretion to buy and play the game.

I was impressed with the game. The story is pretty good, the art is good, the gameplay itself is fun. I didn't notice any bugs and generally it seemed to be a well polished game from my short time on it. I had no real difficulty with the UI which is a nice change from some other console ports; the backspace usage for exiting menus was a bit unusual but that was my only complaint about UI except for not being able to find how to go back to the main menu which surely is there somewhere I didn't see.\\n\\nThe dialogue can be a little corny at times but it's not aiming to be a bunch of grimdark anti-heroes, so it does what it's trying to do well enough with the characters; I'm thinking a good way to put it is like young adult anime writing and tropes. Since I ran through it on a speedrun on free weekend I didn't do many sidequests and look for secret areas and such, but what I saw suggests there is a large amount to do that I didn't see, but I saw enough to give this game a favorable rating. There are also 2 storylines, though I'm not sure how different they are, and a new game + option once one of the storylines is completed, It seems like it has quite a bit of things to do, though I don't know if a feeling of grind would set in or how quickly to play through all the content.\\n\\nGameplay can be a little sweaty at times but there is also an upgrade that makes a character unable to die. I used this after a while on the speedrun once I began to rush through the game. However dodging attacks is fun in this, There is a system where allies' powers can be used to give your character buffs, and the way it works is well done. If I wasn't speedrunning I'd have taken the upgrade off the main character as it reduced the difficulty towards mindless attacking from skilled dodging, but that of course is optional.\\n\\nAppreciate the free weekend, I had never heard of this game before and was quite pleasantly surprised by it; hopefully it has done well enough for a sequel, resources permitting. If I see such a sequel I'll be sure to say nice things about this game in a discussion thread on the topic in my usual haunts if there is such a thread at that time.

Lots of little features feel innovative and indicative of careful design (e.g., the trail you leave on the minimap, voice reactions when items are near).  Character design is interesting and the emphasis on relational narrative development with long, frequent cutscenes is a cool way of bridging the difference in experiences of watching anime (this is my first JRPG that is more \\\"J\\\" than the Final Fantasy franchise) and playing an action RPG, which this very much is.  The combat is surprisingly intense and challenging on normal difficulty \\u2013 there's a real need to learn enemy patterns, evade, use consumables, and combo hard.  The upgrade trees look like they will add plenty more complexity over time.\\n\\nMight've been nice to be able to save and quit more freely throughout, but requiring sustained attention and completing sequences of challenges is probably intended to add difficulty and immersion, which I suppose it does.

The plot is a little clich\\u00e9d with trite high school tropes, but it's not overly cheesy so far and feels compelling enough despite any shallowness, and in terms of content quantity (if not necessarily quality?), it seems to reflect as much developer effort as the action elements.

You control a character who is a member of the OSF (Other Suppression Forces), who uses weapons plus psychic powers to fight the Others, horrible otherworldly monsters who have come to Earth to eat the brains of people.\\n\\nThe core gameplay is decent enough. It starts out pretty simple \\u2013 you have a basic melee or short ranged combo attack, a dash ability (that can also be used to dodge), and a jump ability, along with your psychokinesis power, which lets you pick up (select) objects from the environment to hurl at your enemies. Some of these objects are special interactive objects and will hit the enemy multiple times \\u2013 like something that breaks in half and then you smash the two halves together on the enemy, or a telephone pole you can make sweeping attacks with.\\n\\nAs the game goes on, you gain allied characters, who themselves have special powers which you can \\u201cborrow\\u201d. These range from the ability to set things on fire, to making you temporarily immune to damage, to turning you invisible, to letting you see invisible or hidden enemies, to teleportation (which can also be used to navigate through the environment by teleporting through certain barriers).\\n\\nThe core gameplay is decent but not amazing; there\\u2019s a decent variety of enemies, though most of them basically boil down to \\u201cuse the correct power and use your basic combo attacks on them\\u201d. Still, they have different attack routines, have pretty wildly varied appearances, and manage to put up a decent challenge. Some of the boss encounters are more challenging, and while I only had a couple game overs, they definitely pushed you at times, especially if you weren\\u2019t using your abilities wisely.\\n\\nAs you play through the game, you gain levels and you become more powerful by unlocking abilities from a skill tree, which lets you gain additional moves, improve your combos, use multiple borrowed powers at once, and just get straight up statistical boosts.\\n\\nThe biggest flaw with the game in terms of its gameplay is that it can get a bit repetitive, especially in the side missions; the side missions basically are composed of backtracking through areas to complete kill quests, where you have to kill specific Others in specific ways to complete the quest. As this is all rehashed content, it is not particularly interesting. But even the main story suffers a bit fom throwing a bunch of encounters between you and your goal, where many of the encounters are basically the same thing over and over again; while these segments aren\\u2019t overly long, they can at times feel like they\\u2019re padding, especially when nothing significant story-wise happens.\\n\\nThe real problem with the game, though, is that it is a pretty heavily story-focused game, and the story is not written very well. You will spend a lot of time on the story, but the story was written by people who end up making everyone act unnaturally to preserve the \\u201cmystery\\u201d of what is going on.\\n\\nAt the start of the game, you choose one of two characters (a male character, Yuuito, or a female character, Kasane); while you might think this is just a minor aesthetic choice, this is, in fact, a choice between entirely different storylines \\u2013 the characters not only fight differently (Yuuito being a melee character while Kasane has short-to-mid-ranged attacks) but they experience entirely different storylines and have different personalities. The storylines are in fact the same storyline, but told from different perspectives, so you will see one set of events with Yuuito, and then a second set of events with Kasane, as for the majority of the game the characters are off doing different things in different groups, so rather than doing the same missions with different characters you\\u2019re actually playing through the other \\u201chalf\\u201d of the story line, where you get to see a different perspective on things.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the result of this is that not only do you often not know what is going on, with important events happening \\u201coffscreen\\u201d with the other set of characters, only to have those events intersect with what you\\u2019re doing, but you have little idea that making the choice you do affects who your supporting cast will be for most of the game (though eventually you do gain access to both squads of characters).\\n\\nThe biggest problem, however, is that this is one of those games where weird stuff is going on, events are crazy, and people refuse to explain anything to anyone, even when it makes no sense whatsoever for them to refuse to explain thigs. This is extremely annoying as the \\u201cmystery\\u201d is really \\u201cwhen will someone tell me what is going on\\u201d rather than \\u201cthere is this mysterious thing going on that I need to investigate.\\u201d Indeed, on at least one occasion, you will \\u201cinvestigate\\u201d something only for the person who was with you all along to explain it after the fact because they already knew and were just wasting your time for no reason.\\n\\nThe game struggles to make its story feel compelling as a result; early on, it was kind of neat, but when everyone starts acting strangely, it feels very arbitrary. The core idea behind it wasn\\u2019t bad at all, but the execution was poor, and some of the \\u201cshocking events\\u201d were unfortunately predictable due to either interface spoilers (some characters who are ostensibly going to be your teammates don\\u2019t have the usual teammate data on them, suggesting you won\\u2019t be keeping them as teammates) and just some bits being kind of obvious.\\n\\nWorse, the characters often don\\u2019t act consistently; Yuiito\\u2019s dad dies, and he is upset about it for a bit, and then completely goes back to his usual neutral self only hours later in game. They also seem to \\u201cforget\\u201d some shocking revelations, like asking questions which have obvious answers based on things that they already know (like \\u201cWhy do you hate this person?\\u201d when they already know said person was involved in doing horrible things). While denial is a thing, they didn\\u2019t even feel like they were IN denial about it \\u2013 they kind of accepted it, then randomly derailed, then seemed to accept it again, all without meaningful transitions. People would sometimes go off the rails based on very little for no reason other than to \\u201cmake the plot work\\u201d, and worse, there was often little reason for things to even be that way in the first place \\u2013 they could have just written it differently.\\n\\nAs a result, events often feel contrived and arbitrary, and the characters feel bizarrely oblivious, but inconsistently, other times showing proper skepticism.\\n\\nAll in all, I can\\u2019t quite recommend this game.

I like psychic powers being the focus, there's a nice array of characters, the two stories fitting together to give a more complete picture, levelling up is less of a grinds thanks to an upgrade you get at the beginning of the game... there's quite a lot to enjoy from what little I've been able to play over the weekend it was free.\\n\\nWhat I don't like is how repetitive the gameplay is. Instead of using psychic powers in an interesting way or the more mobile combat style of [b]NieR:Automata[/b], it all boils down to: Stab, bash with scenery, stab and bash again; electrocute / enflame your weapon and then stab and bash; turn invisible, sneak attack, then stab and bash... you get the idea. Dodging can be useful, but if you're using telekinesis to bash an enemy, you're rooted to the spot with no way to dodge. Every battle is a slog with cut-and-paste enemy types with different elemental effects.\\n\\nThen there's the two different super modes. The first is similar to [b]Devil May Cry[/b]'s Devil Trigger, where you build up the meter by fighting. [i]Unlike[/i] DMC, you can't activate or deactivate it when you want, just wait for it to activate when you've cleared 90% of an area. The second super mode is one you can activate whenever (but can't keep going for too long unless you want to die, which I'm fine with), but it makes you slow and powerful with little in the way of defence or health regeneration. Both super modes need to have upgrades unlocked before you can apply those much-needed bonuses.\\n\\nThen there's the story. Having two different player characters experience different events or even the same ones from different points of view can work well if done right. Unfortunately, Scarlet Nexus is too much like [b]Sonic Adventure 2[/b], where one story gets minimal depth compared to the other, and feels like filler than an integral arc. Character side-stories can help flesh out the cast, but it is somewhat shallow with some characters. Not to mention how jarring it is how the cast act all buddy-buddy like nothing happened after the two different parties [spoiler]are on different sides of a conflict[/spoiler].\\n\\nOverall, there's a lot left wanting from what I've played.

Unfortunately, it is one that I cannot recommend unless it is on a deep discount. I played during the free weekend and got through the first four sections playing as Yuito, using the EXP booster that comes with one of the DLCs. Here are my thoughts on the game.\\n1) Combat plays similarly to games like Devil May Cry. Unfortunately, it is far weaker than Devil May Cry. Attacks feel stiff and not fluid. The game does not want to allow you to chain attacks into combos--in fact, you have to unlock combos that go beyond three attacks in the skill tree. \\n2) Other \\\"fun\\\" things you can unlock in the skill tree include charge attacks, air-dodging, auto-pickup of nearby items, and literally getting up off the ground when you are staggered--you know, things that should automatically be in the game.\\n3) Dodging is confusing. It's unclear how many i-frames, if any, that you have, and I found that dodging only worked about 75% of the time. There's a \\\"perfect dodge\\\" that grants you invulnerability if you dodge at just the right moment, but without any kind of prompt to let the player know that it's time to do a perfect dodge (e.g. the signals for counters in the Batman Arkham games), doing the perfect dodge is a crapshoot. Doesn't really matter because half the time I'm dodging away from the enemies, so the half-second of invincibility really doesn't help. \\n4) No way to juggle enemies or come up with any emergent combos. You will play the game exactly the way the developers want you to play.\\n5) No animation canceling. Locked into the elaborate fifth step of the (unlockable) five-step combo and you need to dodge? Too bad. \\n6) There's a psychokinesis system that allows you to throw objects with your mind, similar to the game Control. Unlike Control's system, which made you feel like a Jedi Knight while playing it, this game's object throwing is slow and clunky. About 25% of the time the object you throw will just fly out into the air instead of locking on to an enemy. \\n7) Level design is atrocious. Every level is a corridor with a few hidden objects, and not even a thinly disguised corridor. I'm OK with linear environments, but they should at least look interesting.\\n8) There is an empty and pointless hub world that doesn't even make sense because navigation to different zones takes place using a menu. If you played Sonic Adventure, it's similar to Station Square and just as lifeless--only there's no excuse for this in a game that came out in 2021.\\n9) The \\\"hideout\\\" that serves as the other game's hub looks like the set of an adult film. \\n10) The game is babyishly easy on Very Hard until you get to the bosses, who are either major difficulty spikes or extremely tedious.\\n11) Enemy and boss attack patterns are not particularly interesting or difficult to adapt to. You can beat just about anyone with the ol' dodge + press X.\\n12) Don't worry about how mediocre the gameplay is; every five minutes you will be interrupted by either a cutscene or a tutorial. The game will hold your hand on every possible mechanic.\\n13) The graphics are good, but the art style feels like it's a mashup of three different unrelated games. The characters all look like 3D anime characters (similar to a Tales game), the monsters look like they came out of a surreal Lovecraftian game with far more detailed textures, and the game world itself looks like a bunch of realistic Unreal Engine assets. Compare this to a game with a cohesive art style like Genshin Impact or Tales of Berseria.\\n14) On a similar note, while some of the monster designs are cool, the characters come from the post-2007 anime design philosophy of \\\"draw the same face with a different hairstyle.\\\" Seriously, the copy/paste nature of anime in the last 10-15 years is about to drive me up the wall. Compare almost any newer series to, say, Cyber City Oedo 808, Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, Lupin III, or Fullmetal Alchemist, and the difference is evident.\\n15) Character names are completely ridiculous. One character is named Kasane and her sister is named Naomi. There is a dude named Karen (unfortunately, he doesn't ask anyone to speak with the manager). The extreme thoughtlessness with which mangaka approach Western culture is truly bizarre. Imagine an American writing a story containing Japanese characters named Ching Chong and Hasagawa Jones.\\n16) The writing is a mess on every single level. Not only is the overall plot nonsensical, but the dialogue fails on the sentence level as well. There are multiple lines of dialogue in this game which are so badly translated that they are nonsensical. Where is Ted Woolsey when you need him?\\n17) This might not be a problem except that the game interrupts you with cutscenes every ten minutes. But these are not just cutscenes, but weird, half-assed cutscenes where a small part of it will be fully animated and the rest will be this dreadfully confusing pseudo-comic book thing where stills of the characters whoosh onto the screen and then whoosh right off. I understand not being able to do fully acted cutscenes due to budget constraints, but that doesn't mean that your replacement has to be visually unappealing (see, for example, Max Payne or Tales of Berseria).\\n18) The RPG elements are just padding. Most of the skill tree consists either of \\\"upgrades\\\" that you would already own in a normal hack-and-slash game or barely useful (\\\"5% increase in attack power? Wow!\\\"). The game doesn't actually let you experiment with different builds, so it's not actually an action-RPG (like, say, Dark Souls). \\n19) Good points: Some of the monsters look cool, there's a really cool special move where you can run over monsters with a bus, the fighting is kind of fun. The game technically isn't broken.\\nOverall, this feels like a Playstation 2 game that would have gotten 6/10 from Electronic Gaming Monthly back in the year 2001 or so. It's surprising to me that Devil May Cry was published 20 years before this game, and yet is superior in almost every single way--combat that is deeper and more fluid, a more streamlined story and progression system, anime-themed art style that is both stylish and consistent, enemies with more interesting and challenging movesets. Scarlet Nexus isn't offensively bad, but it's such a mediocre hack-and-slash that there's no point in playing this when all of the Devil May Cry games regularly go on sale for half of Scarlet Nexus' discounted price. Unless you've already played all of the other major hack-and-slash games and absolutely have to play another one, skip this one.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.4054594536290054, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"15 and a half hours of playing this game and at the end of Phase 8.

Brain field felt largely underwhelming when I got it, so I never really used it, it seemed like it would take a large point investment to be useful because of how slow the attacks were, so I just dropped it, occasionally turning it on to throw rocks at things while I run away healing because it was free.

The attack animations, as flashy as they are, don't really do much for me. They're stiff, mostly uncancellable, and end up utting you into compromising positions where you inevitably get hit by a status effect and then can't dodge, further lengthening the suffering and removing any drive to continue playing.\\n\\nSome enemies are just outright maliciously designed to just waste your time. Some tentacle monsters will waddle around and half the time the game won't respond to you dodging them perfectly to counter-attack, which means they get to not only hit you, but hit you repeatedly. One of the bosses has you killing all the adds in the room, while avoiding nearly the entire arena being electrified so you can hit its weakspot, but it puts out spotlights that move way too fast for you to avoid while doing damage with the overly long and uncancellable animations so you end up rinse-and-repeating this for upwards of however long you keep getting unlucky.\\n\\nGod forbid you try to use the \\\"Devil Trigger\\\" of this game. Holding L3+R3 while some kind of condition is fulfilled gives you a 10 second cutscene of you powering up, but really it's a power-down, because you're even more constricted in attacks and movement in this state and all it does is definitively attempt to give you blindness or eye strain with all the visual effects. You don't do more damage, you don't even have combos to speak of, you just mash more.Outside of somehow being plot related there's nothing it helps with.\\n\\nThe story is a stupid mess of anime nonsense. The characters are unlikeable and try far too hard to fit into typical anime stereotypes for literal bottom of the barrel interactions, while also being completely inconsistent with their intent or even personalities. The bonding events you have with them are just a few still images with vapid dialogue, which also encompasses a lot of the real cutscenes. It's Persona boiled down to a single dimension with all the charm drained out for the edgy \\\"brainpunk\\\" clusterfuck of a plot, which I started skipping pretty quickly after the first few chapters. Given how long they seem to be I bet that cut down my playtime pretty good.\\n\\nThe graphics are fine, because it's anime as fuck every character looks exactly the same. You could pop these models out and drop them into the Tales of series and I wouldn't be able to tell the difference, every character in Arise has the same body and face anyway, in this game too, except the two young ones.\\n\\nThis game's bad, it's overpriced, it's overhyped, and it's badly designed. I got it thinking I could get some kinda fun anime DMC with a nice unique aesthetic and I got FF15, with even more corridors and an even dumber plot. There's no depth to the combat, the characters, the story or even the environments. Just a slog of overly long, mostly meaningless prattling cutscenes with levels peppered in that have you running back and forth aimlessly in same-looking, copy-pasted hallways and corridors.

READ AT YOUR OWN RISK~\\nEven though i said i recommend this game. It's mostly a 6/10. Barely above average and barely above a negative review.\\nI played this game when it was free for a weekend and i finished Yuito's story in 19 hours (yes i am insane)\\n\\n1. The story has the most common tropes of 'good guys win at the end'. The protagonist is way too forgiving for what happened throughout the entire game. Multiple people tried to kill me and i couldn't do the same to them and was forced to forgive them, even though their actions were down right tyrannical or on the border of genocide.\\nThe most infuriating thing was the ending, the villain had a really good boss fight (think fighting masked gods, you understand if you played the game). That apparently wasn't good enough for the end, so they downgraded it to another fight where the villain is now a human again for absolutely no reason (maybe considering his psyche is strong enough to overcome the power, but i still think the other one was better)\\n\\n2.The mechanics are janky. Most common problem i've had with it was where i was pinned by multiple enemies at once and i couldn't get up from the ground to fight back. I was stuck in a loop until i was dead and forced to restart either the fight or level. There are though a lot of cool moments considering the fighting. Most satisfying moments of the game were, in my opinion, the perfect dodges. Imagine avoiding death by 1 millimeter which rolls out into an amazing combo where you automatically dash in the enemy to deal massive damage. The dopamine spike you get after each and every one of those perfect dodges is insane, but the problem is i couldn't pull them off consistently (here you can argue i was just bad at the game, but i still believe the boss changing direction mid dodge to hit you is bulls**t). \\n\\n3. The level design is visually stunning, but here we run into another issue. The developers seemed to put too much effort into visuals and forgot to make the game actually interesting. It is mostly linear, with a few exception maze like levels, that are just full of enemies and... that's it. You encounter the same 10 enemies throughout the entire game, with the bosses being exceptions. At the later levels, the mobs that seem to be mini bosses early, transformed into common enemies you find at each corner of the map... without them changing behavior, attack patterns or anything, only scaling damage the same as way the player does. It is basically a enemies filled hallway throughout the entire game. The one thing that made this bearable was the unique design and attacks of the enemies (you have an enemy called 'Winery Chinery', which looks like a combination of a valve, a tree, a human and a horse, if you played you know exactly what i am talking about)\\n\\n4.The bond system is unique but boring. Basically you have to bond with your squad / friends in order to access their powers. At first it's not exactly bad, since you just have to talk to them, maybe gift them something, but later on you have to help them with a mission (for the one who could only play this game for 48 hours, it was boring and tedious, and taking my time from the story)\\n\\n5. The weapons look cool, but are harder to get in a short timespan. Most weapons you just have to buy from the shop, which are unlocked based on level. If you don't farm pieces to exchange them for better weapons or do any quests, it's gonna be more of a skill matter later in the game in order to even stay alive (BUY TONS OF HEALING)\\n\\n6.The skill tree is actually really good, You have a so called Brain Map, and with each level you get Brain Points. In my 20 hours playthrough, i acquired a good 70-80% of the skills on the tree (i was around level 60, max level is 99). You get things like auto pickup of items, faster charging of Brain Drive (sort of a Berserker Mode), you unlock a skill to use multiple powers of your squad at the same time, faster recharge of their power meters, etc, better combos, etc.\\n\\n7. The cutscenes. Oh boy the cutscenes seemed to be so poorly made. Think about this, if you ever played Genshin Impact, you know those fully animated cutscenes, with body movement, face full of emotion, moving mouth for voice over... Yeah Scarlet Nexus has none of that. Most cutscenes are made on what i assume a screen where you see the characters, and another panel where the characters talk, meanwhile not talking or moving in the original panel. In the few moments where the cutscenes are actually animated, it is amazing. It makes me wonder why they chose a 80% bad still cutscenes, with 20% fully animated good cutscenes hybrid. Why not go one or the other? Why give me reasons to compare them and actually think it was laziness they chose with some random spurts of motivation. Some of the fully animated cutscenes aren't even in key moments of the story. They feel randomly assigned. It feels like a wasted oportunity to get the players immersed in the story, or at least, care about characters other than the 3-4 main ones which we are actually stuck with, and not choosing.\\n\\nAt the end of the day. i grinded out the story in 2 days, 60 levels , 80% skill tree, not the best weapons, upgrades, bonds, but pretty decent. Overall my review comes out at a 6/10.

Felt like you weren't given enough time to get to know characters before major events or before you 'bond' with them in game.

Mostly linear corridors with enemy encounters relatively frequently. Different enemy types that call for somewhat different tactics but imo not significant changes in how you fight. Basic attack combos wore me out pretty fast, even the 'brain field'/'brain drive' overpower modes. The most interesting aspect of combat was the 'SAS' mode where you adopt powers of your companions - the strength of which is also dependent on your bond level with them - for a limited period of time to target enemy weaknesses.\\n\\nUltimately felt like the combat and game levels were filler-ish to drip-feed the story and I got impatient.

Maybe that appeal is lost on American audiences, but much of the game felt like a carrot on a stick, and I was never going to get the carrot.\\n\\nIf you've played Phantasy Star Online 2, there's a lot here that will feel familiar, old warts and all.\\n\\nThe good:\\n+ Great soundtrack.

I'm too lazy to get it from the grocery store myself, but I'll give you a pat on the back for your troubles.\\\"\\n- Combat feels pretty much the same after a short time. Do your main combo, enemy dead. Slightly different enemy, do a gimmick to weaken it, do your main combo, enemy dead. Repeat ad nauseum.\\n- Feels like fighting with marionettes. Hits have no weight. You slash a monster, it flinches. Maybe it sometimes falls down. You get hit, you fall down, you hop back up (with the right ability). Are you doing good?

Great game designers have been introducing \\\"How to play\\\" into tutorial missions for yeas, so you barely realize you're doing a tutorial. Why are you interrupting every moment I get to play with a two-page explanation for a new ability that I have to read? All of this should have been in some kind of \\\"Episode 0\\\" training mission.\\n-- Do you like menus and submenus? Because the devs sure do, and good luck locating where to quit. I seriously spent a couple minutes on this. Not okay.\\n-- The camera is terrible. Enjoy getting pinned by an enemy on a wall with the camera pointing anywhere but where it would be useful? Targeting helps, if you happen to target the right enemy, otherwise, it involves a combo press to switch targets, which may eventually get to the one you want.\\n-- The camera is terrible. I said it twice. It was not fun babysitting the camera. It felt too close, even when I was given a ranged view. Maybe the character was placed incorrectly, but I always felt claustrophobic, like my face was pressed against the glass.\\n-- The controls were made for a controller. You are releasing a game onto Steam. There shouldn't be two different ways to exit various contexts (Esc or Backspace). I don't mean you can use either/or. I mean you can only use one or the other, and it's not always the one you expect. Publisher should have spent some time investing in a proper control scheme port.\\n-- You don't get to really play for long. You spend less time fighting than you do in the overworld or watching dialog scenes.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.03176631494279502, \"joke\": 1, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"good game\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.03405093920707454, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"8.5 great game\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.022147364555734943, \"joke\": 1, \"review_type\": \"Negative\", \"review_text\": \"it just didn\\u00b4t catch me.

Because of the free weekend play, I went into it, and I was very satisfied in some aspects. I highly recommend this game to fans of hack and slash games.\\n\\nThe visuals and the music are top-notch, and the locations range from breathtaking to merely so-so. You can usually explore them in a linear fashion, but there are some bonus items scattered around. The game saves itself automatically but you can also do it manually in certain places. Enemies can be farmed, and there are side missions that test your skills but feel rather scripted at times. On the negative side, you're constantly bombarded by tips that cannot be turned off, plus irritating offers and reminders from NPCs that deliver all too familiar information.\\n\\nChoosing between the two protagonists at the start of the game is far from insignificant; each has their own storyline, journey, team and enemies - intersecting in some cases. Yuito is more melee-focused while Kasane favors ranged combat, yet to get the full story players will want to experience both. Fortunately, New Game Plus helps so you don't have to restart your progress after your first cycle. Luckily it's an easy game anyway.\\n\\nThe characters of Scarlet Nexus are one of its most valuable assets. There's almost two dozen of them, each one interesting and half of which can be called in to join your party at any time. When taking a break from the story, you can chat with them in their Hideout, give them gifts and deepen the bond between you, which will pay dividends during fights - if the bond is strong enough, they'll save your skin more often, perform additional attacks and make your skills last longer. Interactions between characters are often funny, providing some much-needed levity against the heavy atmosphere of the main storyline. The cutscenes may put some people off with their comic book-style presentation, but I had no problem with it whatsoever.\\n\\nFights are a joy in this game. Despite being simple at first, they become even lighter and more rewarding with increasing time and skill. Enemies have lives and shields which, if taken to zero before health, can be executed with a fantastic short animation on the press of a button. Crafting also allows you to upgrade weapons to newer levels. Apart from that, accessories, both functional and aesthetic, are also available. And once you unlock the ability tree in the skill tree, up to 4 abilities can be used at once for intense combat results. In addition to this, characters in your party can bring up to nine abilities into a duel situation which makes beating enemies satisfyingly fun. With the ability to throw objects at enemies or take them out by riding on top of a bus full of them - no wonder it's so delicious! The design of these foes is incredible, although there aren't many varieties and species (as some modified versions tend to repeat). But it's enjoyable watching them die as each killing animation looks great!\\n\\nThe fun doesn't end there. The Brain Drive allows you to accrue bonuses when dispatching your adversaries and then, of course, there's the Brain Field. As soon as you fill up the second indicator, you can trigger it and be transported in style to a stunning environment with slightly different rules than what you're used to. Your character is suddenly crazed feeling with wild laughter let out as he wreaks havoc on his foes. You'll need to get out of this place fast, or risk damaging your brain by overstaying your welcome, but thanks to the ability tree some god-like power can be yours; double your time, maximize your attack power - all while enjoying a good chuckle!\\n\\nThe fights and the styling of Scarlet Nexus are among the best in the world. There are some lapses in the story, but you'll be happy to skip them because the gameplay is so addicting.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.05769453647788385, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"A Good start for anyone setting the foot on anime games...\\nThe story continues as a manga and comic like but i like anime themed ones...\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.012796551467999209, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"where wall-e\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.014150203003272225, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"It's good.

It starts off as this \\\"brain punk\\\" anime action RPG about fighting \\\"others\\\", which are these weird monsters that humanity has been fighting against for thousands of years - but quickly expands out into this insane story with layers upon layers of twists, turns, and conspiracies. Everything becomes way over the top and pretty much stays that way the whole way through, just like you might expect if you're the kind of person that has ever watched anime. Personally, I enjoyed the hell out of it - yeah, there's a bunch of dumb anime tropes*, but there are also some really cool characters, stories, and adventures to be had in Scarlet Nexus, and I really enjoyed my time with it.\\n\\n*like conflicts that could easily be resolved if people just opened their mouths for 2 seconds instead of just staying quiet for no reason, and the dumb grubts/gasps that anime characters have to do constantly for some reason.\\n\\n[b][u]Gameplay[/u][/b]\\nOn the gameplay side, everything is extremely fluid and combat is super flashy and satisfying. Scarlet Nexus does a great job of giving you some basics to play around with (either the sword with Yuito or the floating knives with Kasane + the psychokineses power, dodges, perfect dodges, etc), but then piles on more and more and more and more mechanics throughout the game, but not in a way where you feel overwhelmed. As you level up and progress through the game you unlock things like additional combos, the ability to borrow your party members' abilities, the insanely powerful brain field, and so much more. The key here is really how good of a job they did at giving you access to these things slowly, so you have a good amount of time to get comfortable with what you have available before they throw a bunch more on your plate. I really enjoyed borrowing a bunch of my party members' synergistic abilities at once to dish out insane damage, and the perfect dodge/retaliation system is super satisfying too. \\n\\nI will say I really don't enjoy the quest system - you have to go out of your way to pick up quests by wandering around areas you'd normally never bother going to, and quest givers usually don't give you any indication of what you're even supposed to do for the quest, so you have to open the menu every time to see what you actually even need to do. Also, the quest requirements 99.9% of the time boil down to \\\"kill x enemy in y specific way\\\" which isn't all that interesting because you often have to backtrack to an old area specifically to pull that off. Quests are pretty pointless unless you're either going for achievements or wanting to give all the gifts to your platoon mates though.\\n\\nThere's this bonds system with your platoon members that's really awesome. You get to do these little bond missions/episodes with everyone in your squad, and some pretty interesting stuff happens sometimes. They're not all super interesting, I admit, but some of them are really cool, and I liked seeing the little side stories play out. Also, investing in this system grows your bonds with your squad mates, which in turn powers them up more and more. It's really satisfying to see how much more powerful you become by doing the bond missions. If you have the DLC, definitely make sure to unlock the nexus drive and crush vision levels (past level 6), they're incredible.\\n\\n[b][u]Story[/u][/b]\\nThe futuristic dystopia of Seiran, Suoh, and Togetsu is a really awesome setting to have a game in, and I loved all the brain punk stuff too. You get some hints of things early on that play out in a really interesting way later. One of your squad mates early in the game says something along the lines of how thankful they are for government censorship. Yeah. I don't want to spoil anything so I won't talk much more about the story, but I'll just say this. Scarlet Nexus is an anime game and has all the baggage that comes along with that. It's over the top and has probably a few too many twists, and there are some pretty cringey moments to be had. But there's also a lot of cool stuff that I enjoyed seeing. I played both Yuito's and Kasane's route, and watched the DLC Karen episodes - all of which are really worth doing if you're enjoying the story. The two protagonists' stories converge at several points (the ending, for example) - but there are also a lot of differences and independent parts that cover different things going on in the world. It was really neat to see some of the stuff I was a little fuzzy on (why'd that happen? etc) get cleared up when you see the other side. \\n\\n[b] That being said, I do wonder if they took the \\\"telling a story from multiple angles\\\" thing a little too far in some spots.[/b] I really enjoyed it, but a couple of my friends played the game and absolutely hated it, particularly because once you get into all the twists and surprises later on things can seem arbitrary and confusing, and some things won't get explained in much detail unless you commit to playing the entire game again on NG+. Not a problem if you're as into the game as I was, but a real turn-off for anyone on the fence, I'm sure. This goes for the DLC Karen episodes, too. They explain a lot of what was going on behind the scenes throughout the game and I wish we got a little more of that throughout rather than just available to you at the end. \\n\\n[b][u]Music/Visual Style[/u][/b]\\nIncredible music and awesome visual style. Fights are fluid and flashy in a really satisfying way. Cutscenes are typically told in an almost comic book-esque manner, which is fine, but it'd have been nice to have them all fully animated instead of just a couple. \\n\\n[b][u]In short:[/u][/b]\\nIf you're willing to put up with the dumb anime stuff and strap in for a super over the top story with some cool moments and characters, intensely fluid action combat with a lot of abilities at your disposal, high energy music, and that \\\"very anime\\\" visual style, I'd highly recommend picking Scarlet Nexus. It goes on sale pretty frequently for like $20-30 with everything included, which was super worth it in my case.

That is \\\"Baby's first RPG, made to this year's technical standards\\\". If you've played similar videogames before (roleplaying games, visual novels, third person slashers) you'll ultimately find nothing new or fresh here, merely a collection of most reliable and safe tropes and ideas fused together.\\n\\nThe decription seems interesting and the early hours feel fun with a promise of bigger and better things to come, but ultimately it devolves into regurgitating the same themes and mechanics over and over again, most unfortunately.\\n\\nThe game is labeled \\\"Brain Punk\\\". The amount of times the word \\\"brain\\\" is mentioned in and out of context is astonishing. It's all about brains. It's always about brains. Even when it's not about brains, brains get mentioned. Some brains can withstand pressure, some brains avre very strong, some are too weak for this or that, and some characters also have brains, which are important for the plot. Did I mention there are brain fields, brain drives, brain messages, a brain crush move, a [strike]skill tree[/strike]brain map that you fill with [strike]skill[/strike]brain points, and a brain-to-brain connection system which is, surprisingly, called a Struggle Arms System?\\n\\nNow that I've mentioned the braindead naming and writing... A few other things.\\n\\nGraphics are... Nice-ish. There's definitely some design work, but overall the game looks like just unsettling and hallucination-like that it's hard to get immersed in (certain areas are just lazy and downright [strike]bad trip-like[/strike] quirky).\\n\\nAudio is okay. There are voiceovers over comic-like presentation and there's music. The combat sounds are mediocre.\\n\\nThe combat system is pretty flat. It looks like it's going to get better eventually as you acquire more powers, but it pretty much stays at X-X-(X/Y-X/Y)-Y-Hold RT-Repeat. You can use certain borrowed abilities but those don't add much variety, only some efficiency. And some abilities are mandatory for certain enemies on a Pavlovian scale - See enemy X, activate ability Y, proceed as before. You can't choose an approach like melee focus, ranged attacks or magic. You just mash everything together randomly and fights end, eventually.\\n\\nThe characters are bland. Yes, they seem mysterious and look like they have their own agendas, but they really don't. Everything and everyone is there to service your chosen protagonist, just from a certain trope angle. And the amount of times I asked myself \\\"What the hell are you/he/she/they doing?!\\\" was pretty damn high. The game never bothers to explain the characters' motivations or have some characters question other characters' sanity. Just because!\\n\\nThe plot twists and turns and it's really hard to guess what's going to happen. But it's even harder to get invested and keep caring. Stuff just happens, gods come out of machines, mysterious things and actors are revealed and immediately discarded. The world is built on a need-to-know basis entirely.\\n\\nBut the biggest sin is how low bar and family-friendly the game is. There is no immediate gore, you fight [i]monsters[/i] only and every idea, plan or motivation gets repeated at least three or four times so that no player would miss it. In between the monsters, the combat and the global plot you get [b]bonding episodes[/b], which can range from silly to stupid but serve an important purpose - improving your combat interactions with a certain character, so they are somewhat obligatory. And these tend to be very wordy and tone-deaf.\\n\\nBut don't be discouraged - there are brain fields, brain drives, brain messages, a brain crush move, a [strike]skill tree[/strike]brain map that you fill with [strike]skill[/strike]brain points, and a brain-to-brain connection system which is, surprisingly, called a Struggle Arms System!\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.0238904509682696, \"joke\": 1, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"The writing of this game was done by someone with the power of bipolarity.\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.010926501475675835, \"joke\": 1, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Good RPG, 9/10 combat, 7/10 enemies/bosses, 6/10 story,  overall 7.5/10\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.03442360603028262, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Went into this game not expecting much, but it definitely beat expectations and then some.\\n\\nOne of the few games I've cared for the entire main cast.

At about the 10th chapter of the game the developers went \\\"screw this\\\", and made every encounter basically identical. Every fight you have consists of the same enemies from previous sections of the game, in almost an identical order, and after 3 hours of it I'm feeling like giving up. The gameplay has become so monotonous, with new areas just being slightly edited versions of previous areas, and almost identical waves of enemies making the, at first quite fun, combat irritating as you do the same moves over and over again. And don't get me started on the boss you have to defeat 4 times in a row with slight changes to the moveset between attempts and the boss itself basically being invulnerable to attacks apart from small weak areas which change with each form. I also don't think you are available to save between each phase of the boss, meaning if you die on the last phase you'll be doing it all again. I believe the fight took me about 30 minutes in total which I did in a single life.\\n\\nController is required.

Extremely fun and promising start that falls flat in the second half.\\nMixed feeling about the game. Dropped in the end because I lost interest.\\n\\nThe story starts up asking some interesting questions and mysteries but then quickly just starts dropping the \\\"plot twists\\\".  Its one of those cases where I would rather not have had any twists, as they mostly twisted the game in the wrong ways. Also the emotional beats suck a lot. There is one point in the game where\\n[spoiler] Yuito's dad dies and this is hand waved in the span of one chapter? He lets out a few tears and then we immediately stop focusing on it. An argument could be made that Yuito's dad was so distant to him all his life so Yuito didn't feel much, but we never get anything to suggest in the game. And don't get me started on the Darling in the Franxx style \\\"its all aliens\\\" reveal in the 2nd part of the game. That is where I stopped. [/spoiler] \\n\\nGameplay is the main reason I stuck with this game as long as I did because damn its fun. Plays actually pretty similiar to Tales of Arise. The SAS abilities are extremely fun to use and I really liked the enemies requiring different SAS activations to beat. However, as you get closer to the end of the game you need to use this less and less. It would have been much healthier for the game in my opinion if they kept the SAS abilities more limited than giving you all of them by the end and 4 to be activated at the same time. Also seeing that anime cut that stops the whole game really discouraged me from switching between them often.\\nI have very mixed opinions about the Brain Drive feature. Its cool and I like that it kills you if you don't exit it on time, but damn its the most frustrating gameplay feature by far. If you do not upgrade it, you are actually kind of weaker than normal while inside of it, and if you do upgrade it fully the whole game becomes even more boring as you can't combo and its just button mashing.\\n\\nMusic is outstanding. Really liked the tracks in the game. Gave me heavy Kekkai Sensen vibes with the instrumental tracks. \\n\\nCharacters are good. Some are kind of basic, but some have had a surprising amount of depth to them and have had very fun interactions. Some of their actions in bonding events also didn't match their reactions in the actual story which was very off putting.\\n\\nSidequests are ass. They sometimes feel worse and more pointless than an MMO quest. Its kill 3 of this or kill 5 of that. They have no substance. Skip them if you can, unless you are going for all achievements.\\n\\nAll in all I would usually recommend you play the demo first as the data can be ported over to the main game.

Surprise surprise\\n\\n+I must start by saying visually this is up there among the most stunning JRPGs out there. From the world to the characters to the animations to enemies to the dungeons. Everything about this game just looks great. I rarely ever take screencaps of my games but dam this game made me stop to screencap it a bunch of time. Enemies are all visually distinct and honestly have some disturbing designs if you take the time to let them sink in. The animations of moves is just really good. There is always a lot on your screen yet it doesn't feel too much despite all the clutter.\\n\\n+Soundtrack is so dam good. From all the many tracks of the different areas to the opening theme song done by Oral Cigarettes that is such a banger that it makes the playlist. Special shoutout to the hospital dungeon which didn't have a backing track and just random noises which spooked me. Sound design overall is super good, the moves just feel so meaty when you hit them and the way the soundtrack slows down during hypervelocity is such a nice touch.\\n\\n+The voice acting was really good as well. I didn't try the English dub but dam the Japanese one goes hard. There is a bunch of notable VAs in the cast like Yuito having the same Japanese VA as Yuji from Jujutsu Kaisen. That being said, all the voices of all the playable characters does a great job.\\n\\n+The gameplay is so fire. It's hard to contain how fun the combat is in words but dam there is just so much constantly happening on your screen. I think brain crushing might be the most annoying thing about the combat but besides that the combat is just so addicting. The weapon combos are visually satisfying, the psychokinesis attacks sound so meaty and feel good to hit. The L2 psychokinesis attacks with the quick time events were engaging and didn't get annoying to do. The real star of the combat was the dam SAS system. You get to use your teammates' powers temporarily and when you upgrade your brainmap such that you can use more than 1 at the same time, the game just becomes so much more fun. It also helps that this game is not just brainlessly mashing, you will find yourself needing to go for perfect dodges into counters versus bosses which I will admit did beat me a few times.\\n\\n+On this note, there is no powercreep. You can use whichever party members you want in this game and you don't even need to really invest in them as the brainmap system is only on your main character. You can freely swap characters based on who you like without having the pressure of caring who is better.\\n\\n+The dungeon design was really good. Maybe the levels themselves were a bit too linear but honestly I don't really mind the linearity. The different maps didn't feel derivative and I always have to go back to how great this game looks. They really make it feel like you are in the place like in the mountains being a long climb rather than segmented or the abandoned hospital not having a soundtrack to make it creepy.\\n\\n+The playable characters were well-developed. Each character has bond events which you use to get to know each character better. Maybe the characters were a bit too trope-y but they executed them well. I liked the character development they go through individually throughout bond episodes and even characters I didn't like at first, like Shiden, I ended up appreciating and even going out of my way to using.\\n\\n-I think the static cutscenes might seem novel at first but it does ruin the experience. I hate the action scenes done in stills instead of actual action. It does take away from the experience and is a really big deal especially since this game has a lot of cutscenes. This is actual a major downside as it does make going into the story much more boring. Somehow despite everything seeming really high budget, the static cutscenes feel so low effort. This also affects the bond episodes because there is so much and it does make it a slog to go through some especially when it is your second playthrough. I am so unsure as for why they chose to do this and why people greenlit this idea.\\n\\n-The actual side characters could use more work. Kodama was the best design and had so much potential but we didn't get to see much of her develop. We also never really got to see Fubuki in action the whole game.\\n\\n-The story had some pacing issues. The narrative was decent but the pacing sometimes just went in overdrive and we get information overload. They tossed in maybe a few too many plot twists just cause they can. Overall the narrative wasn't bad but pacing issues and static cutscenes really killed the story portions.\\n\\nSuper super fun game.

Brain field is kinda boring to use, especially when you get full damage reduction, unless it is against Gunkins, in which case spam it as much as possible to speedrun through that slug of a fight. Luka's ability is mostly useless, and is only useful to run away during brain field or against certain boss attacks, so don't feel so bad about not leveling up his bond, he's already used to the lack of social interactions thanks to his brother. Most of the bond episodes are pretty cute, though some are boring, which brings me to cutscenes.

I have the tools, but it's still pretty slow.\\n\\nSo I looked up a plot synopsis to see if the story of the game was going to live up to the hopes I had in the early game.

However if I had to complain I would say the humanoids bosses are not fun to deal with as they just keep running around and dodge your attacks while having super armor when attacking you. The dodge timing also feels off especially when you cannot animation cancel out of attacks to evade attacks.\\n\\nThe two playable character has the same power with slight differences to their attack pattern and starting companions. I heavily recommend playing Yuito first as the story revolves more around him and Kasane's story fills in a lot of the missing context after the fact.\\n\\nStory wise I think its very by the formula. Maybe a bit on the weaker side compared to Tales game but it has its moments. Down side for me is the pacing of the character bond system as they have some bond episode occur at the most awkward point of the story that feels just out of place.\\n\\nSpoiler for those who want to understand what I mean. All and all a good game. I'd buy it on a sale but its not bad even as a full price game in my opinion.\\n\\n[spoiler]At one point you'll be pitched against the other playable character and their team in the backdrop of a civil war. One character would be actively trying to kill them for real all while after the fight (and they remain hostile to eachother) several character from the other group would trigger their bond episode immediately afterward meet up with you and basically be like \\\"Hey sorry for trying to kill you earlier, I'm still going to try to kill you later, can't explain it to you right now but hey lets have a nice chat and get some friendly bonding going.\\\" It's all the more weird that you can completely skip these bonding epsiode and the characters won't acknowledge this happened regardless if you did them. \\n\\nThe main story starts off with some difference between the two character up to the mid point but by the end game they go through essentially a near identical story as they join forces. You cannot play the other character despite teaming up with them and on multiple maps the only difference is areas you can access due to your different starter teammate's power (like Yuito has teleportation while Kasane has timestop which serve similar function to attack enemies that raise their guard when you are close to them while Kasane has electric for doors/damage while Yuito has fire. The mobs like wise are weak to fire or electric based on which character you play and wont make any difference until later points when the whole team is together. Playing other character only really just show their perspective to the same over all story rather than being a different story completely.

Something to keep in mind is that this game is very story-heavy, so there are a lot of cutscenes and they tend to be pretty lengthy. I think the story is quite good, even if it goes into some common JRPG conventions that I personally don't care for. Characters have a surprising amount of depth in their unique side scenes, and the two playable characters each have their own perspectives. I wouldn't necessarily recommend immediately switching from one to the other, and by the end of one playthrough you'll know the gist of both, but overall I'd say it's worth it after taking a break.\\nAs far as gameplay goes, the combat is fun and has a lot going on despite your core moveset being pretty small. Borrowing the powers of your party members modifies your core actions in different ways, to exploit the various weaknesses of enemies. I think the difficulty is quite balanced, and you can change it at any time without worrying about it affecting anything like EXP or item drop rates. There's unfortunately not a lot of side or post-game content (outside of DLC) other than crafting items and equipment. It can be quite a grind if you actually try to get everything (especially things added by DLC), but it is by no means necessary.\\nSome last random thoughts... The soundtrack is full of bangers, and dynamic music that shifts between area and battle versions. Enemy designs are a great blend of goofy and creepy.

Once you've beat the game as one character, you can then NG+ into the other character to see both sides to this wonderful connecting story. This always creates an air of mystery & excitement and keeps a good beat to the story, always wondering what you'll see next for your cast of characters, and wondering what you may learn when you play as the others. The story is definitely one of the biggest highlights of this experience with multiple layers of conflict that somehow find a way to still connect to one another, and gave us an opposing entity that may be one of my new favorite 'villains' I've ever experienced in gaming. The only element stronger than this game's fantastic story is it's wonderful cast of characters who all have unique personalities and individual goals, and with a similar support system to Fire Emblem give you extra Bond Episodes to spend more time with them and appreciate them more. By the end of my journey I ended up loving every party member I had, even if they weren't on my team throughout the game. Scarlet Nexus also makes excellent use of knowing when to have animated cutscenes so they can be more impactful, ultimately leading to a constant interest in what's happening.\\n\\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\\nTo get as an anime-style hack & slash title an AAA style treatment is rar and this absolute knockout hit all the right spots for me. Gameplay wise this game is for me action genre at its finest. Always feeling rewarding to play even in the basic combat, this game goes a step further by making your main character(s) a psychic user. Throwing around objects and doing big combination attacks always looks as cool as it feels to do it, then goes to the next level when you do combinations with your party members to also use their powers. Teleportation, Duplication, Super Speed and more just give you more ways to enjoy playing this game, which is already enjoyable to do. As you play more you unlock more things you can do with each party member, and expand the detailed skill tree that's one of the best I've ever had in a game. \\n\\n[b]Graphic/ Sound[/b]\\nThe art and animation were well done, I really enjoyed most of the areas and levels of the game. People how are fans of the cyberpunk setting, will like the world of Scarlet Nexus. You can switch the outfits of almost all the side characters and it also changes in all the cutscenes which is pretty cool. The game in general looks very aesthetic, very well design decisions where made (like the red strings or the designs of the enemies..). The soundtrack to this game was phenomenal. Lots of future sounding stuff, mixed with a lot of funky beats and basslines. The emotional parts had many beautiful and swelling songs behind them as well.\\n\\n[b]Negative[/b]\\nThe game can get pretty boring during the \\\"Standby Phases\\\" (free time in-between the chapters of the game). This is due to the boring side quests and the companion system which takes hours to complete (complete meaning fully level up your relationship with your team) and if you're a completionist like me, then its possible that you get burned out like halfway through your first campaign from that mechanic. Don't get me worng: the bond episodes in the companion system are great, I just wished to get to them not by just throw on my team as much as possible gifts all the time. And the game, even when the presention is top tier, is at the end an mid-budget project.. so you will see a lot of re-used environments and most of the cutscenes are slide-shows. Also be aware: Since there are two campaigns with lots of overlap, game can get repetitive towards the end - especially because I felt like the game is 2-3 hours to long in the main story itself. \\n\\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\\nScarlet Nexus is a fun action RPG-lite that has a complex story and a bunch of loveable and well-written characters. If you like games like Astral Chain, Persona 5 or being a cyberpunk (/brainpunk) fan, you will not go wrong with Scarlet Nexus, especially as it\\u2019s being set up as a potential future franchise. The combination of telekinesis and action elements are nothing new, but SN does it beautifully by combining it with other different skills and magics. I just can say: Thank you Bandai Namco for this.

The start of it felt really slow though and I was debating on not finishing the game. The combat felt similar to God Eater and Monster Hunter, which the game is made by the same people, which to me feels slow and clunky in those games. But as I progressed, it started to become more fluid and interesting, as you gain more abilities and allies.\\n\\nThe game is not all that easy though as the enemies can pack a decent punch and knock you around no matter what level you are. Most enemies have a stagger/armor bar you usually need to deplete first before being able to hit their main HP bar. Utilizing the abilities greatly help with this process and is preferred over a simple hack and slash. The creature designs are pretty interesting and very well designed. The whole game has a really nice design, very detailed and has a cyberpunk aesthetic.\\n\\nThe story in the game is truly interesting and sometimes confusing and can't even be explained in simple terms without a major spoiler. The game has 2 main characters and while you could technically only need to play the game once to understand teh story, doing the 2nd play through with the other character is highly recommended to get the full story as key parts are missing since you can only experience as if you were that character. There are side quests and Bond quests for your team members and the bond quests are so in-depth for background lore on each characters and provided a nice step away from the main story during stand by phases. There are comedic moments when the characters interact with each other but these are mostly found in the Bond episodes as the main narrative is pretty serious. The side quests felt a bit tedious to do and you could actually go the entire game without even noticing a side quest giver as my first paly through, that's what I did. They are spread out and don't stick out easily.\\n\\nOne thing I really wish the game had was a romance option, and not meaning one you could pick yourself, but a predetermined one. Part of the main story has a side note of romance and it takes a backseat overall but doesn't expand on it even in post game or at the end. It then further expands the notion in a Bond story, but never really explores the idea and I feel it would've brought another happy ending to the already in place ending that was really heavy and brought a tear to my eye. Doing the ending a second time was like twisting the knife in the heart. \\n\\nOverall excellent story driven game that is mostly linear with a deep story and character lore. Heavy ending that I really didn't see coming, satisfied with, but kind of wanted a little more. Amazing art design and cool flashy combat/characters. Touching story, heavy parts through the experience, with a heavy ending. Voice acting was actually surprisingly good with only a few parts that felt off putting when delivering a few lines, such as a specific one early on when Seto was talking to Nagi that felt like it didn't need to be said. Combat may take some time to get use to, but stick to it.

This game was such a great experience. The combat was fun and satisfying, a lot of the environments were beautiful and atmospheric, and it wasn't difficult at all on normal. Very well tuned to my preference these days. Somehow an ARPG helped me relax every day after work. I don't have much else to say about the positives of the game; I'm just really happy with the overall experience. I am however, going to point out some issues below, and it's a shame they'll probably consist of the longer component of my review. I just want to make sure they're crystal clear, in case they weren't abundantly clear from the top rated reviews here.\\n\\n1. The game's story and areas are ultimately very linear. While you do have free time between story phases, areas progress in a straight line with minimal branches from the main path. This will bother some more than others. Personally, I don't mind this kind of design (I loved Final Fantasy XIII, to give some more perspective).\\n\\n2. The new photo mode is a fantastic addition, but after all this time, they still haven't added an option to hide the UI for it and the skip button. So it'll be on your screen 99% of the time and you'll just have to get used to it.\\n\\n3. The side quests are extremely lackluster and add nothing to the world other than extra experience with the various combat mechanics the game introduces. However, this ultimately doesn't help, since there is also no option to disable tutorial tips. The game was still telling me how each ability worked as I activated them during the final battle... lol.\\n\\n4. The requirements to raise bond level seem to be ambiguous and heavily dependent on gift giving and story progress. Why the game is unclear about this aspect in particular but holds your hand everywhere else baffles me. This issue is amplified by the fact that certain rare drops from enemies (required for some gifts) are brutal to farm unless you have a someone's ([spoiler]Tsugumi's[/spoiler]) level 6 SAS bond ability (even then it sucks lol).\\n\\nWith all that being said, the game still easily earns a thumbs up from me. I just don't understand how some of these very obvious aspects of the game weren't addressed before release (or a year afterwards...).\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.28458791787236776, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Kasane is definitely on the Autism spectrum.\\nThey re-use the maps way too much.  I don't mean \\\"you can go back to the map for side quests\\\", I mean like they will have 12 main quests in a row that only use 3 maps between them.\\nAll the cutscenes have a really weird thing where they render the entire 3D scene, but then only show a single \\\"frame\\\" of it with the character jaws going up and down.  It feels very weird, because it's basically the indie \\\"storyboarding\\\" cutscene hack to save budget... but using 3D so not actually saving any budget?\\nThis is not like a Bioware RPG where you get meaningless choices during dialog.  The character designs are fixed, and the story is fixed, and your only real story choice is \\\"watch 'character development' cutscene?\\\" (in return for a stat boost).\\nThere are only two combat styles, each one tied to a specific player character.  Try the demo to see if you will hate it too much!  Playing the demo also gives you a couple of cosmetics.\\nThe crafting and cosmetic menus are badly organized.  There's like 800 elements and you can't even go up/down by 1 page at a time, so scrolling through them takes fucking ages.\\nYou can put new hairbands and earrings on all ~10 teammates, but it doesn't remove their default accessories.  So it looks kind of stupid.\\nFor each character you can choose between 2-4 different outfits, each with ~4 different texture/color/pallette swaps.

If I had to give a comparison of what this game is like, i'd say it's like a real-time battle version of persona. The difference is there isn't much in the way of weapon synthesis etc. \\n\\nThe main cons of the game is that the difficulty spikes super hard early on in an unexpected way, making you wonder if the battle is winnable or not. While you can change the difficulty setting, i feel that this shouldn't be necessary. I really do hate when games spike difficulty with no notice. I'm not the greatest at these types of battle systems but i didnt have a single game over until around 70 to 80% of my playthrough with kasane.\\n\\nBy the looks of it, the 2 protagonists have very different stories to be told since they are not in the same party for most of the game. Kasane is one of the most straight forward, and efficient realist protagonists i've seen in a game. From playing from her perspective, I really feel that this game is superior to most game storylines out there on the market today. Give this game a try.

It's not like Code Vein or DMC or any other anime or character action game I've played, and it's not like a lot of other JRPGs out there, for sure. I guess the closest analogue I might have to it would be something like Kingdom Hearts, but it lacks a lot of the quality of life features that make playing KH on harder difficulties more engaging, and it's just frenetic and disorganized in exchange.\\n\\nI think the best part of the game for sure is its cinematic presentation; everything you do has an undeniable style and flair, and the game rewards you for chaining these flashy attacks together to not just beat your enemies, but absolutely stomp them into the dirt. It clearly wants you to use your psychic powers to smash enemies into oblivion and bro-connect with your teammates to do incredible things, but the problem is that while this is all well and good and easy on Normal mode, on Hard mode the game is clearly not scaled to let you do this meaningfully.\\n\\nSo, say you're encountering a bunch of enemies that spew out fog. You need to connect with your vision-providing party member to lock onto them and use your most damaging psychic moves, and you need to connect with your fiery party member to trigger the enemies' weaknesses. You've got about 30 seconds to a minute of this connection ability, and then you have to wait for it to recharge -- and it usually can recharge well enough between battles. That's all fine on Normal mode.\\n\\nThe problem is that on Hard mode, enemies are fat sacks of HP and stamina such that even when you play perfectly and chain your attacks together correctly and all that jazz, all of that connection power takes... About half of their HP. So they're still there, and now you're out of juice because you literally *can't* deal enough damage to overtake them. You either have to take potshots and fear for your life, or you have to focus down one enemy, wait to recharge, then focus down another enemy -- because the vision connection is the only way you can reliably hit an enemy with your psychic attacks because you need to lock onto them, which you can't do through the fog that the enemy spews.\\n\\nThe other issue is how slow your character feels, despite how fast they actually move. Often, I found myself getting hit by stray, aggressive enemies in the middle of an attack that was supposed to keep them stunlocked, that I also couldn't dodge out of. The perfect dodge window is incredibly finicky, you're wide open while doing almost all of your regular attacks, never mind your psychic moves, and enemies just don't care that you're walloping them relentlessly and will super armor through everything you do because you're not damaging them enough to stop them.\\n\\nEverything on Hard mode is scaled to make your life absolutely miserable, and often (unlike many other hard modes in many other games) there is NO recourse to even make it fair. When I get defeated in this game, I don't feel like it was my fault, and I don't feel like there's anything I can learn from it other than \\\"don't attack\\\", because then when I'm not attacking, I can evade -- except I can't evade forever. At some point, you NEED to be able to hurt the enemy.\\n\\nI try to play games on their available hard difficulties because I enjoy challenging myself, but that's the thing -- I enjoy *challenging* myself, not getting kicked in the balls because the game's rules state that getting kicked in the balls is just what is supposed to happen. I'm probably gonna finish this game eventually, but I don't think I'll enjoy it even if the story is some really fun over the top anime stuff.

the game has its flaws, i've enjoyed it pretty much.\\nEspecially since, while still enjoying it, i was kind of dissapointed from their last entry Code Vein.\\nBut lets beginn with easly the best aspect of Scarlet Nexus an this is its gameplay.\\n\\n[h1]Overall Gameplay:[/h1]\\nFor every action jrpg fan out there this should be a no brainer, the game lets you choose from two protags.\\nYuito (the male one) is more of an mele pased hard hitter, while Kasane (the female one) is more methodical and uses midranged weapons.\\nWhich one you choose is completly up to you, they dont differ too much from each otehr both have psychokinesis and even thou you can keep your distance with Kasane, Yuito in general is easier because of the bigger damage output he has from simply slashing the enemies.\\nThe main difference between the two is in the companions that accompany you the majority of the game each with theyre own unique abilities which i wont spoil here.\\n\\n[h1]Battlesystem:[/h1]\\nThe battlesystem is very dmc like, basic 2 button physical attacks with a psychokinesis ability that makes you feel more like an jedi than most star wars games ot there.\\nMost of the time you'll gonna just throw simple objects at your enemies but there are special objects from time to time which can be used to deal massive damage or even whipe out full enemy groups.\\nSome of them you need only to interact with, some are qtes, some can be controlled (like drones) or even used as an vehicle.\\nBesides the hp bar, enemies have a second one named crush bar, which can be depleted with constantly attacking, once depleted it stuns the enemy and leaves them open for a finishing move.\\nWhile keeping the core mechanics quite simple it adds just the right amount of complexity with passable enemy variety and companion abilities (SAS) which you can use to eather buff yourself with a specific ability or just simply calling them for attacks to use in your combos.\\nThis system starts out pretty simple since the game takes its time to introduce each companion and you have to to level up the bond level to use them to theire fullest potential, how i will get to later on.\\nBut at least on higher difficulties you will need to swap pretty constantly SAS and combo attacks, especially late game to keep pressure on the more robust enemies to kill them faster with depleted crush bar instead of slowly chopping down their hp.\\nSome bosses on hard you may get stsomped pretty hard at first, because they are more like a puzzle how to punish them without taking dmg, they make a nice change of pace and it is really rewarding to finally take them down on higher skill levels.\\nSadly they do recycle some bosses throughout both runs.\\n\\n[h1]Leveldesign/Graphics:[/h1]\\nThe areas look pretty nice with an somewhat unique cellshading style to them, especially the towns look gorgeous with buildings pattered with animated holographic adds, street signs etc., sadly there is little to nothing to do except of accepting sidequests from npcs.\\nLeveldesign on the other hand is pretty linear with the occasional dead end where you can loot stuff, some of them have interconnections inbetween rooms and might seem pretty complex at first glance but in general you dont really have much choice where to go next.\\nSidequests are pretty dull too, its the typicall kill enemy x with y attack/skill etc., some of them can be pretty frustraiting since they require you to finish off enemies with attacks you normally wouldnt use as last hits.\\n\\n[h1]Story:[/h1]\\nDue to budget constrains most of the Story is told like an VN, with panels and character portraits, it didnt really bother me that much since it was pretty decently executed and i pretty much prefere this than models just standing next to each other with little to no animation how many other jrpgs do it.\\nPlot in general was pretty enjoyable to me, nothing to special but overall pretty solid despite fulfilling nearly every shonen anime trope, they throw constantly new plottwsits at you especially at the beginning and they mix up many different which i didnt have thought at first and might sound little but riddiculous if i would summarize it, but if was executed decent enough for the most part to not throw me off.\\nIts a bit of a shame that often mentioned organizations, responsible for some bad events dont really get a face, they get mentioned constantly but somehow feel disconnected from the plot simply by not attaching any characters to them except of \\\"This facility is owned by ... , i never was more ashamed to be a ...\\\", in general there is a lack of real antagonists and interaction with them, you often fight some but dont know really dont know why, one female antagonist i still dont know what she was up to and you fight her multiple times.\\nYou dont necessarily need to play both protags to understand the story but you probbably should to really get whats going on and the reasoning for some characters.\\n\\n[h1]Party:[/h1]\\nThe party on both protags is likeable for the most part, not all of them are that relevant to the games story and are pretty much replacable, but there is no companion or character which i hate.\\nAfter every chapter you'll get a standby phase where you can interact with you current party.\\nYou unlock new bond episodes with a companion by using them in battle, progressing the story and giving them gifts.\\nThe hideout where you can do this is pretty nice, not that big, but pretty detailed, nice side effect of giving your companions gifts is that they actually do decorate the hideout with them an ocassionally interact with them, its nice to see how much love went into this and i really appreciated it.\\nMost of the bond episodes are just casual interaction with the protag like going into an cafe or something like that and they dont really refer to much to what is actually going on in the story, which can be curse and blessing at the same time.\\nEven thou they are locked by story progression some of them turned out pretty pretty badly, or at least pretty pretty badly timed, to an extend where they dont really make sense or even let the cast look like a bunch of morons completly forgetting whats going on no matter how bad it is.\\nIn general they really could have done better here, less in quantity more in quality, since there is really much time to spend here, but to the time amount spend on bond episodes, they really do little to really flesh out the characters.\\nI'm not saying they dont do it at all, but even if (to an extend) most of them are enjoyable, they end up pretty meaningless overall.\\nI just have wished they would be more related to the events happening, not those anime clishe slice of life stuff, its little bit better on Kasanes side but not by much.\\n\\n[h1]Soundtrack:[/h1]\\nI liked it, the tracks fit pretty good into the world and there are even some banger tracks which i definitely put into my playlist, but really nothing to outstanding here,\\nsince this is probbably the most subjective part i really dont know what else i could say here.\\n\\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\\nFor final thoughts i really appreciated it, the developers finally to take there own route, they finally set them appart from simply copy other franchises like they did with Code Vein and the God Eater series.\\nSome of the systems were already present in Code Vein like a gift system, but much better executed here.\\nI'm really hoping they continue this series and improve on what is already here,\\nsince the world and the whole concept really has the potential to be truly great,\\nit just really needs some fine tuning in terms of world building, more meaningfull interaction with the party and the world and maybe a little more complex leveldesign would be nice.\\n\\nThe gameplay is clearly the carry here and i really recommend it despite its flaws to almost everyone who enjoys jrpgs and a good portion of action combat.\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"},

Too much grinding for little reward.\\nIt deserved more animated cut-scenes, it really feels like you are reading a graphic novel, and not playing a video game.

It feels like a mess, but like I said, will make sense and be cool in the end. Soundtrack is very in line with the game's theme, some are spot on, some are completely out of character, like you are wandering on the underground, with loads of monsters trying to eat your brain, and the music feels like you are strolling by the beach with your loved ones.

I have only played as Kasane.\\n \\nThe story was pretty well formulated but in my opinion it gets way too convoluted in the latter half. They keep throwing plot twists and surprises at you and the story just keeps getting more complicated. Maybe a good thing for some people but for me I think they should have dialed it back a bit. I only know the Kasane story but I\\u2019ve heard that the two story lines aren\\u2019t too different. Also they spoil each others story line so you kinda get a vague idea of what happens in the other character\\u2019s story.\\nEach side character has several bond episodes which are like side stories where your character and others hangout and deepen their friendship. I enjoyed most of them and doing them makes their powers stronger.\\n \\nThe gameplay/combat system was super fun. It revolved around their telekinesis power and something called SAS. I found flinging objects around to hit enemies enjoyable and some stages have special objects that do a lot of damage and have a unique animation. SAS is basically the other side characters sharing their power with you. So if you connect to the teleporting guy you can teleport and the same applies to any other character. A lot of enemies have special features where it was incredibly difficult to fight or attack them without a specific power.\\nThere\\u2019s a skill tree that makes you stronger that I was able to get around 95% complete by the end. I only did a minuscule amount of grinding so just doing the main story should get around 80-90% of the tree unlocked.\\nOne thing I gotta vent is that some of the stages are waaaay too tedious, especially the one leading up to the final boss. While clearing stages you encounter regular Others (\\u201cOthers are what the enemies are called fyi) and then major Others which are kinda like mini bosses. The major ones aren\\u2019t particularly difficult but their health can take a bit of time to whittle down. So the problem is the final dungeon was absolutely littered with mini bosses and it got really irritating fighting like 30ish of them. I quickly ran out of those special objects and honestly I feel like I did something wrong because jeez it was way too time consuming to get to the final boss.\\n\\nThe art and animation were well done. You can switch the outfits of almost all the side characters and it also changes in all the cutscenes which is pretty cool. But I feel like they should have used their time and resources better because a lot of  the cutscene animations were cut short and they fell back on still images. Idk if there\\u2019s a direct connection between them but I personally would have preferred more animation time than being able to choose what they wear in the cinematics.\\n\\nOne of my favorite features was decorating the hideout and seeing the characters interact with their decor. Idk why I liked it so much but they kind of ruined it by making the drops to craft the decorations completely random. The only way to get some of the materials is to just keeping going to the same stage over and over until you get lucky so I didn\\u2019t finish some of the decor.\\n\\nHonestly there\\u2019s somewhat similar games out there that are better but it was still a decent game and I don\\u2019t regret buying. $60 might be a bit too much for what it is though so I definitely recommend waiting for a sale if you wanna give the game a try.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.510384063648848, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"BANDAI obviously has some very talented people working for them.

Characters actively comment on things you do during combat and even as I'm typing this review, I have the game open in the background, with characters in my party making comments on how it's important to rest, if their hair ties are dirty, and other quips. Once again, the soundtrack coupled with the new-age city tech environments is simply eargasmic. If you were looking for a more serious iteration on something like Genshin Impact, you've found it. I'm more of a gameplay and atmosphere person but the story had a sort of Wolfenstin: New Order \\\"human cruelty tragedy\\\" to it, and I felt sympathy towards particular characters. It also helps that the characters are diverse in their attitudes and personalities, even though some aren't that in-depth. It gets funny and spunky sometimes, if you're not used to games having a dignified serious attitude that's sometimes naturally poked at by a teammate's comic relief due to a mentally stressful situation.

Then people get turned into monsters and immediatly afterwards  things in the 3rd chapter ramp up to 50 and the society is now having some sort of civil war during this scene the freedom fighters unleash monsters on helpless civilians and Kasane who is with them kills Yuito's defenseless father who he seemed to have an ok relationship with leading up to this point, he sounded like a decent proud father who didn't want his son in the military. \\n\\nNow that she has carved up his dad Kasane now wants to kill Yuito but he's really strong and beats her so she runs off. The dad dies saying sorry to his son who could have use first aid on him.

I just can't with this writing what is even going on?? Why is the Mc still being so docile???\\n\\nKasane should be a fade on sight Idc if the father was a bad guy...

The only things Scarlet Nexus has in common with Code Vein is the art style, fridging a LOT of female characters, and plot, in that you really shouldn't think about the story too hard or you'll start drowning in plot holes.\\n\\nThat being said: wow.  This was an unexpected experience that caught me entirely by surprise.  Two protagonists with their own independent stories is wild enough for a game like this, but they really didn't mess around:\\n\\n- The female protagonist is strong and cool as hell.  She's also portrayed as having a lot of autistic traits with social situations, most notably represented by her failure to read and understand how people interpret her words other than what they are at face value.  Other characters view her as \\\"blunt\\\" or \\\"honest,\\\" sometimes to her detriment, but these traits are never used to characterize her as a bad person.\\n\\n- The male protagonist is the opposite of edgy.  He collects dolls and keychains.  He's literally just a guy trying his best.  They could have very easily swapped his and the female protagonist's personalities and gotten the usual anime game experience, but they did not, and the game really benefits from that.\\n\\n- The game does not force the protagonists into a relationship, despite the fact that they are linked together in a lot of very concrete ways.\\n\\n- The character who has the appearance of a ten year old kid but is actually decades old is never treated like a child.  Usually you'd see a girl and be told she's a thousand years old or something, but this was a decades-old man in the body of a child who is regarded in high respect for his wisdom and guidance.  He's treated as such, too.  It would've been a stupid gag that fits in with these kinds of narratives, but they didn't go for it once.\\n\\n- Very little fanservice.  I cannot state how refreshing this was.  No boob physics, no weird camera angles, no side episodes featuring swimsuits or whatever, nothing.  (The outfits are far more revealing for the women than the men, but for a game like this, I was surprised at how tame they were.)  The one character who's the designated flirt - and an adult by a good margin - even acknowledges how creepy it could be if he actually was hitting on a teenager.\\n\\n- The characters are not only written consistently but actually grow and change throughout the game.  Not only that, but the way they interact is written consistently and grows and changes over time.  This shocked me the most.  The story is really not that good, but the characters are so well designed and voice acted that I felt invested in learning more about them, and that meant progressing.\\n\\n- So many flavor interactions when you're running around on the maps.  It's really fun.\\n\\n- The voice acting (at least in English) is really good.  Arashi's VA knocked it out of the park.  I can't emphasize how good it is.\\n\\n- You give gifts to people and they decorate with them.  By the end of the game, your little home base is a colorful mess of stuff for each character.  There is such a good eye for detail, too, because characters interact with your gifts and other things in the home base independently of you.\\n\\n- This is more of a sidenote, but: the character who has a crush on the male protagonist gets along really well with the female protagonist.  There isn't any weird catty rivalry or anything.  They're just friends and it's really cutely written.\\n\\nBeyond all of that, the combat is stupid fun, or at least it was for me.  Combining powers and finding out what works best against what enemies was a steep learning curve, but once you understand it and get better at dodging, it feels so fluid and fun and awesome.  I really had a good time with the fighting portions, which could be tough but not unforgiving.  The DLC adds an item that also keeps you at 1HP minimum in case you want to just cheese through the game, which I think is a great touch.\\n\\nAll that to say: I liked this game a lot and I didn't expect to.  You might also like this game a lot if anything here resonates with you.  Either way, it's worth giving this game a shot when you have the time.  It might just surprise you.\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.3159110535403706, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Negative\", \"review_text\": \"I wanted to like this game.

I honestly was surprised by just how much I enjoyed this game both from the style, story, and characters. Going in I expected a fun romp, with some decent sci-fi story and I got way more than that. The characters are written and executed so well, and everyone feels alive within the world itself. There are typical JRPG themes that are followed, but it very much strays from that and leans into the sci-fi genre where the world moves with the characters and the characters are not the sole source of conflict and change. The overarching plot is very much a mystery thriller, with a lot of information left for the player to either observe or learn later. Some have complained there are plot holes but I personally fail to find any. Any answers you might want seem properly there in the game itself. I really appreciated feeling connected to the character's sense of \\\"what in the fuck is happening\\\" because there were still more mysteries to uncover. \\n\\nThe gameplay itself is nothing to scoff at either, once I really hammered down how to utilize my allies' abilities and the way the flow of battle went I found myself really enjoying every fight. It really helps that the game enables you to feel like you're directing an action sequence with the way the cut-ins, and other sfx, weave their way in. \\n\\nSolidly recommend, there's even a demo and your save data gets imported into the full game. \\n\\nMusic also slaps.

So what's wrong with plot? \\nFirst of all I don't beat the game and you'll understand bit later, so I'll go through some things\\n\\nThis game's plot is anime (people only talk to you when you beat the crap out them) x soap opera (oh how convenient) x anime (some superficial things that combine with soap opera) type\\n\\nSo I was mostly enjoying the game untill you divide in the teams. You encounter the same person over and over again and instead of saying few sentences they all being jerks. K and her team is that stupid I'm wondering how they got exams passed. You fight with them over and over to get nothing and they all manage to escape, but if you lose, then you're dead. And imagine you could improve bond with that person just after they tried to kill you. So that irritated me so much that when K person asked to talk (and day before didn't want to do that and wanted to kill you) without any reason (what a fast character development!), I just don't even want to talk with their team, because just looking on their stupid faces irritates me. I wish I could connect plugins to their team from their head to rear and leave as that. There are few people who ok there though, but definetily not ones you need to fight several times. If I would be given choice to exterminate most of their team and get the bad ending I would ended it like that, but because there is no such scenario I'll drop the game on this spot. But even here I see a lot of plot holes and stupid decisions that I'm not sure how they will fill.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not against that someone want to kill main character. But because they playing mute even if saying something will benefit them too. It would be Ok to fight them once or twice, but you need to fight them several times and it's more frustrating. Because of wasting your time with some crappy talk, they've could said few things and that would be the end of it.

It's always satisfying to get a nice finisher in on an enemy.\\n\\nThe game is available in a native Japanese or English setting, which is a plus to some. Voice acting is very good as well.\\n\\nOne thing that urked me was the item they throw in your inventory right from the beginning - a \\\"You can never die\\\" god item. Having such petty options in a game always seems tasteless to me. ANYONE can boast they beat the game in X fashion, while we may never know if it's true or not.\\n\\nI certainly recommend this game to any action game fan.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.03548370596286149, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"most of my time awake has been spent on this game recently; 9/10 game if you like jrpgs\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.0729810849613881, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Ignore my playtime I walk away from games while they're running.

I brought the difficulty down to normal then easy. kept up with upgrades it was still completely stupid and obnoxious how many enemys they throw at you. If I could put in a mixed review I would. the end quarter of the game really hurts the experience overall. you get really invested and it drags you through the mud to get to the end. and then halfway through the long final boss I got a unreal crash and it put me back nearly 20 mins of boss fight because it doesnt autosave at stages in the fight. I **almost** uninstalled right there and said \\\"fuck it i'll watch the ending on youtube\\\" but I didnt. \\n\\nthe first half of the game is great. the gameplay is fun. the story is fantastic the whole way through. the terrible end stages ruin the game for me brings it from a 9/10 to a 6/10 overall just because of how bad the bullet sponge enemys get. you can play through twice as both the female and male protagonists. and you *will* get different storys for most of it. lots of interesting stuff happens in the male half and the female half has tons of stuff I have no idea about or things I was told happened that I would really need to experience. but it feels like this is a 14 hour each side story that is stretched to 22 hours now. I am not a completionist but I did do a fair amount of content. still. I honestly can say if you dont turn it down to very easy once you notice that each section is go to the next part and fight 3-5 waves of annoying enemys with too much health you will be stretching your playtime out for about 4-6 hours of what feels like very frustrating and tiring grind. I cant imagine playing this at the hardest difficulty even knowing how to deal with each enemy. throwing 4 long range enemys and 2 big tanks in at once when they all can take too long to kill really ruins the flow. \\n\\nabsolutely buy this game if you are interested. lets ignore the end part its a 9/10 I think.  just honestly turn it down to very easy at the end there. and speedrun through the gameplay sections when you can and it will be not as bad.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.02473403586226715, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"10\\\\10 amazing\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.02843462279098451, \"joke\": 1, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"One of the best looking anime cyberpunk style graphics.

It's brimming with potential. The combat is fun, the SAS system is awesome and adds a unique layer to fights, the character customisation and bond/gift system that decorates your HQ as you play adds a lot of character to your party, etc. \\n\\nHands down though it's strongest element is it's visuals and presentation. The enemy designs are so rad, the animations and poses are fantastic, the brain-punk aesthetic is killer and combat really pops with colour thanks to the effects on the SAS system attacks, the whole thing looks great. Love to see modern games with distinctive and colourful character designs and effects rather than trying to be photorealistic.\\n\\n(Before getting into the negatives, let me just say I totally recommend picking this up if it's on sale. The first 20 or so hours are well worth it.)\\n\\nHOWEVER It also definitely has its fair share of problems, namely the severely limited number of UNIQUE enemies (I guess that's the trade-off for each of their designs being so cool). There's probably less than 10 fully unique enemy types (not including bosses), as most of the enemy variety comes from a handful of variations to each one of their enemy archetypes (for example a bird-like enemy has a speed variant, a fire variant, and a lightning variant). If this game was half the length, that would be more than enough for most encounters to feel fresh, but the later you get into the game, the more of a problem it becomes. Especially because you'll be revisiting maps you've already been to multiple times throughout the main story. \\n\\nIn my opinion this games length is its single greatest weakness. I like long games, but there's just not enough content variety here to stretch over a 30-35 hour experience. Towards the end of the game you're fighting the same enemies you've been fighting all game for 15 minutes straight because they lack the variety to organically increase the challenge, so instead they just throw greater numbers of those same enemies at you with stupidly high health bars. I played the first half of the game on hard mode and loved it, but by the last 1/3rd of the game I dropped it down to normal just to get these fights over with faster. It really feels like they ran out of funds and just dragged themselves across the finish line with padding. \\n\\nThese complaints are exactly why I hope it gets a sequel though, because what IS here is really, REALLY good. It's just spread too thin. Now that they've built up the assets, mechanics, world building, visual style, characters, models, voice cast, etc. I'd love to see where this IP can go.\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.017326795452166466, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Marry me Tsugumi.\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.12499187312035313, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"pretty good game, high impact anime hack and slash with interesting powers and modifiers to base combat based on party members.

The story was unique and interesting and the characters are SO compelling that I was dedicated to getting to know them all. I'm not usually the type to collect every single gift for every single character, but watching my friends interact with their favorite knickknacks in a cramped hideout was charming. I bought a massive, GIANT plushie from a certain monster collector merch store because I was jealous of Yuito's Baki plushie.\\n\\nCombat mechanics and skill trees were simple to learn and players are rewarded for utilizing all the tools made available to them.

This. game. is. pulling you out so much with these INSOUFFERABLE video sequences. I wish i could get my money back. It was only around 10\\u20ac but that's way too much already. This is no game. It's a bad manga with voice-overs. I haven't played many JRPGs but if hits is the best that comes out in a year they have a lot of catching up to do. Western indie single developer games tell better stories than this shit and keep you invested for more than this honestly subpar anime dialogue.\\n\\nHonestly why are video sequences 5 times as long as fighting sequences if this is the story you want to tell. Whoever invested in this game must've figuratively felt like they were having a brick shoved in their face. Playing this game hurts so much. Nothing redeemable about it but a AAA game. You'll have a 1000-fold of the fun this game provides when doing fetching quests in Ghost of Tsukishima or your 100th outpost clear in Just Cause 3.\\n\\nThis review may be harsh considering i only have played for around an hour. But trust me. I tried. There's rarely been a videogame so repulsing to me. And i stopped playing Genshin. That game btw is free. It's predatory as hell and doesn't have a good story either considering they're playing the usual \\\"it'll just never end but become more and more complex\\\" card. They at least understood that you can't indefinitely save monitarely on front-end and art departemnts of game development. There has to be something to keep the player hooked whilst telling your story. The best but most expensive way is video sequences but there are other means as well. Don't fall back on this trash anime game s*** all the time. The worst obv being Jump Force. Honestly Scarlet Nexus makes a good contender for the least investing game of all time in comparison. At least jump force had a REALLY NICE fighting system and was promotional towards many great anime. \\n\\nAt the end i wanna say what this game should've done to be good. It would've cost a lot more time, effort and money but this game here didn't take long to develop anyway so all i can say at that point is do it or let it go.\\nMake ALL THE CUTSCENES anime. Go all the way. If you tell a straight up anime story and don't have that great and distinguished gameplay but a story you want to tell, pay up. Pay a good studio, trim down the HOURS AND HOURS of insoufferable - and i use that word a lot here because it encapsulates perfectly my mood writing this - dialogue and make a better gameplan in the first place. This secret formula you think there is for anime games to be successful might work out for a while in terms of income but long term you're producing hot s*** and there's nothing redeemable about your game. Stop wasting the patience, lifetime and braincells of your buyers.\\n\\nI hope the money earned through this game is enough to make a game worth playing. I hope the JRPG industry keeps evolving more towards games like Nier automata or Devil May Cry to really flesh out this niche game department with over the top characters and fast paste anime action story's.\\n\\nAnybody reading this.

If you don't, like me, I would rather prefer a game option where you just go to a hub, select your mission and go straight into action.

The side quests are not compelling, either.

The game play loop is similar to games like persona but dumbed down. Instead of a dungeon or what have you, you're just exploring earth as a whole. You will do storyline 'missions' which are separated by 'standby phases' where you socialize with your group, give gifts, watch bonding episodes like those in  Xenoblade Chronicles, and do side quests. Fortunately nothing really seems too time sensitive quest wise but I was not a completionist by any means. \\n\\nI did however play both main stories. You do get what is essentially the full story on one playthrough, but with most games like this the ending is the same for both stories, it's the first 75% where there's some differences primarily in the 'missions' each protagonist goes on and some individual story bites, as well as the team members you are forced to use for that portion of the game. \\n\\nI will say that if there's a secret ending or something to unlock by meeting some criteria I definitely didn't do that, so correct me if I'm wrong there. \\n\\nThe game does use new game + features, and the normal game comes with a no lose button (an accessory that prevents you from going below 1hp) as well as a 2x xp multiplier so if the typical daunting grind of a jrpg is holding you back, it helps.\\n\\nOverall I'd give this an 8/10 the combat is unique and refreshing in some ways but at the end of the day it's a lot of damage sponge enemies and gimmick enemies, and really the combat loop does become boring, granted I played both stories back to back so it might just be over exposure. The mini map shows icons of intractable stuff in the level and literally calls them gimmicks which is a bit funny, at least they recognize it.\\n\\nYou'll be seeing a lot of your typical anime tropes in this game, and they deus ex you a few times, but it's an original enough concept and the characters are all likable enough that overall its a good experience. The story could be better, but it isn't glaringly cringe by any means. If you like linear games with an OK story and entertaining combat it's an alright new IP. They left enough in there to make a sequel or prequel without making it a cliffhanger. If you don't like games that force social shit on you though you will be handicapping yourself by not doing it, so keep that in mind, too. It's not difficult, just a lot of unskippable scenes.\\n\\nOverall it's worth a buy, likely not at full price but it's good enough to drop 50 hours on if you enjoy the combat.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.22023217438548345, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Negative\", \"review_text\": \"I\\u2019ve tried twice to give this game a fair shake and all I can say is what I\\u2019ve played of it is so generic, so bland it just feels like I\\u2019m wasting my time playing it.\\n\\nI could overlook the boring story, cliched writing about the power of trust and friendship and the, frankly, terrible graphics (you\\u2019re lucky if you look at a character and they actually have a shadow half the time) if the gameplay was at least fun but it just isn\\u2019t.\\n\\nIt seems the developers wanted to make an action RPG but got half way to a good combat system and suddenly changed their minds. It seems they actually made semi-decent combat mechanics and then intentionally gimped them for the sake of making you work through a skill tree to completely unlock it. Want to be able to heal mid fight without waiting for an animation to play? Spend some skill points. Want to be able to recover from being hit? Skill points. Want a four hit attack combo? Believe it or not, skill points.\\n\\nThe combat feels clunky, and the main culprit is there is no dodge cancelling: once you commit to an attack you\\u2019re in it until the animation finishes playing and combos almost seem to queue like a JRPG. Hit the attack button 3 times and you\\u2019re firing off that combo, even if you\\u2019ve stopped pressing the attack button long before the 3rd attack starts. It frustrates the flow of combat to no end, encountering situations where even though you\\u2019re pressing other buttons the game just seems to ignore the fact you\\u2019ve asked for it. So many times I\\u2019ve tried to pull an Arial launcher by hitting X+A only for my character to just stand there and take a shot to the face. Things only get worse when you take in to account that there\\u2019s a perfect dodge mechanic where the window for dodging just doesn\\u2019t seem consistent: some attacks will only trigger a perfect dodge window if you dodge a nanosecond before an attack hits you, where some will trigger so early that it\\u2019s actually possible to miss an enemy with a follow up attack and they just plough right in to you. The baseline dodge also inconsistently has no iframes, so if you dodge but the enemy is still within attack distance there\\u2019s a chance you\\u2019ll still be knocked down. I say it\\u2019s inconsistent because it really makes little sense: giant horse enemies have an AOE attack that delivers consistent damage if you stay in the zone but you can chain dodge out of it if you get caught, only taking damage between each dodge, but Brawny\\u2019s (weird mechanical gator enemies) can hit you mid-dodge during an emergence animation. \\n\\nThen there\\u2019s the psychokinesis attacks which are your special, and require you to use a chunk of a gauge to perform. The game explains to you pretty early on that following up attacks with psychokinesis, then following them up with another attack is a good way of chaining damage against an enemy and breaking down any armour they may have, but your attacks rarely interrupt enemy movement or attack animations and these follow up attacks will usually fling you straight in to an enemy attack that will knock you on your ass.\\n\\nIn addition to this, you\\u2019ll usually find yourself with 1 or 2 party members in combat but their AI is absolutely brain dead, doing the bare-minimum of attacks and taking absolutely no steps to defend themselves from attacks. They seem like they\\u2019re just there to act as a minor distraction when you\\u2019re facing a gang of enemies, but even then 9/10 times the enemies will aggro to you with laser like focus. Fighting enemies with AOE attacks will annihilate your team mates because they just run at the enemy and in to the attacks like they\\u2019re suicidal, which leads to situations where you\\u2019re spending most of your time picking them up off the floor so you can use their SAS abilities. You can change their default behaviour in the party menu but I\\u2019ve found it does little to their survival instincts.\\n\\nThis probably wouldn\\u2019t be so bad if you could control them directly: they level up just like you do and can be kitted out with weapons and augments just like you and probably would have made the combat system far more engaging than it actually is, but again this seems like something that has had the bones of established but the developers just gave up on.\\n\\nConsider all of the above with the rest of the problems the game has which just seems to point to a poor plan of how to make an enjoyable game and focusing resources in the wrong areas and I just couldn\\u2019t play it anymore after 6 hours. I found myself sticking the EXP booster on with the intention of just getting through the game quicker before I took a step back, realised I\\u2019d done it because I wasn\\u2019t enjoying myself and finally decided in turning the game off and walking away.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s obviously had some care put in to it, but to me it looks like they\\u2019ve put that care in to the wrong parts of the game: there\\u2019s been great effort put in to the design of the games neon-futuristic aesthetics, but the graphics, especially for environments, are bad, the hub city is a few streets with absolutely nothing to do in it other than get meaningless text box exposition from random NPC\\u2019s (\\u201cOMG this Arashi poster looks so cool!\\u201d ~ Arashi Fan), the mission maps are long, empty and ugly looking corridors with basic healing items as your reward for exploration, the enemies are weird (stupid weird, not unsettling weird) and are limited to 6 or 7 base models, the cutscenes are 99% in-engine storyboard stills because it was cheaper than animating actual scenes, the characters are textbook anime tropes but have incredibly bland designs and boring powers, all the female characters have a wide-on for the male protagonist despite him having all the personality of plained timber that someone has sharpied a face on to, the female protagonist is  a walking \\u201cIm cold to everyone but my sister\\u201d trope and the story is so monumentally dull I was picking up my phone to check Reddit during cutscenes after the first couple of hours. \\n\\nI could have powered through if they\\u2019d actually made a good combat system - the reason I finished Chorus despite its myriad of problems was because getting in to fights was actually fun and it made me want to keep playing. But it\\u2019s so frustrating to almost see the potential of what it could have been and see the game completely go in the opposite direction for some reason, possibly rushing to release as a next-gen launch title when it would even be considered a mediocre last-gen game. FF7R was a goddamn PS4 title and it does every single one of Scarlet Nexus\\u2019s elements better by orders of magnitude. \\n\\nAnd with that I come a realisation about this game: the combat system, the pseudo-futuristic aesthetic, the concentrated linear progression - it all just seems like they wanted to do their own spin on FF7R, started make a last gen game, but saw an opportunity to rush it out to hit the next gen launch window.\\n\\nAnd in the end what we ended up with was one big grey lump of meh with some red neon resting on top.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.03876818893239138, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"I played through Yuito's story, and have started Kasane's.

It's very rare that I give a review, but I really saw the potential in this one, and it ended up disappointing me.\\n\\nOne other thing, the game offers two different story paths. I chose \\\"Kasane\\\", the silver-haired girl that you see in the trailer, not only because I thought she looked cool, but reviews online said her story was better.\\n\\ntl;dr this is a copy-paste combo of nier and persona but fails to appeal to either audience.\\n\\nOne thing before I start, I apologize if I missed a few things, I didn't want to write an entire book report, and I didn't want to give a lazy review.\\n\\nPlot - The plot of the game is incredibly creative, and very interesting at that. Unfortunately, I can't explain much about it without spoiling a bunch of the game, and I found it very interesting and kept wanting to know what would happen next. I'm generally a person that struggles to open a game twice, so this was very rare and impressive to begin with. This is about the most that I can give to this game, unfortunately.\\n\\nExecution - The execution of this story is without a doubt, the worst writing/production I have ever seen. It literally feels like it was a short story you'd write in middle school. There seemed to be no direction until the very end, which is an obvious issue, but the storytelling is terrible. Major plot elements are scattered throughout the game with their context being given ten minutes before it happened, almost like the writers didn't have a full idea for the story and just winged it as they went on with the game. This was most apparent when (Trying to keep as spoiler-free as possible) you did not find out what the main antagonist/final boss's motives were for what they were doing until twenty minutes before the game ends.\\n\\nCharacters - If I tried to pick something else this game tried to do and failed miserably, it is the characters. This is one of those \\\"my friends are my power\\\" RPG's, Like Kingdom Hearts, Persona, etc. Unfortunately, these characters are so bland and terribly developed that it just feels unbelievably cheesy when it is mentioned at all. There is a mechanic in the game (which is just a blatant copy-paste of social links/confidants from persona) called Bonds, and basically, hanging out with specific characters in the game increases combat abilities with said character. Unfortunately, unlike confidants, do not make you sympathize with the character whatsoever. The characters are not developed whatsoever and talking to them is never meaningful. Later in the game when things happen to them or they try to back you up, it brings zero feeling at all. Once again, the antagonist was written horribly. He actually could've been a really good character with more focus to him and his motives I believe, as he represents a stark contrast to the protagonist's view on a similar struggle that they share, but was brought down horribly as you learned nothing about him in this (super long) game until the last twenty minutes or so. Also, the protagonist does not grow as a character at all. You start off way stronger than your peers, learn nothing along the way, and do not get any more powerful at all. Literally the only thing that the protagonist learns/gains throughout the story is to be nice to other people and trust them. There were no difficult situations conquered, and it was incredibly difficult to sympathize with any character as they received zero screen time outside of the mandatory plot-telling. There are a few heart-warming parts with the main character growing to like the people around her, but nothing ground-breaking. Also, I didn't really know where to put this, but I had to mention that the English voice acting is terrible. I would definitely recommend playing with Japanese voices if you are going to play this game.\\n\\nGameplay - This game has some of the most tedious gameplay I have ever experienced. This felt similar to the early dragon quest games in pure frustration. The game has a somewhat watered-down combat style of Nier: Automata and isn't as fleshed out or fun. There are a few gimmicks like copying your party member's abilities, but these are not used creatively and all you really have to do is activate their powers before approaching a certain enemy type that requires you to use said ability and spamming the attack button. The fights are not engaging or challenging, they are boring. \\\"Hard\\\" enemies, are not difficult to defeat, they are damage sponges. The only fight where I saw any challenge were two of the final few bosses. You literally just dodge, hit hit hit, and repeat for minutes on end, even with proper leveling. This is not mentioning the fact at all, that fighting the EXACT SAME TEN ENEMIES is 95% of the game's content. Every time you think you're done, another wave spawns, and then once you defeat them all, you walk forward another ten steps and you're in a new fight again. I eventually got so bored, that I hacked the game to one-shot every enemy because it was that horrible. I need to mention that even while being to one-shot enemies I was getting frustrated with the pure amount of fights I had to endure just to get to the next bit of story. If I didn't hack this game there is ZERO doubt in my mind that I'd have never even finished it.\\n\\nDesign - The art direction is generally really cool and well executed, and the concepts are cool too. It's really futuristic without going for an obnoxious cyberpunk design. It was super impressive to walk around the city outside of Sumeragi Shrine and the OSF headquarters. The technology ideas that the design team had were super cool. There's not really much else to say about it though, it wasn't a masterpiece.\\n\\nSoundtrack - The music is pleasant to listen to, but again nothing groundbreaking. Some of the boss themes were really nice though, and I liked the OP.\\n\\nSummary, if the game is on sale and you have nothing to play, I suppose you could go ahead and get the game. If this concept/plot were given to another studio like ATLUS, I think they could've made a 12/10.  I don't know if it was budget, or what, but the team so obviously cut so many corners that it diminished the quality of the game severely.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.022538703640846224, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"this is my fist game i buy in my life.

Combat mostly is about cycling through the skills on cool-down, fighting the same enemies over and over again just in different combinations of enemies pitted against you. Map exploration is practically non existent because there is nothing interesting to be found. The music is bordering on something playable in an elevator.

The writing is somewhat better than expected, but I feel like it tries to be a few things and doesn't go far enough in any to be truly distinct. The aesthetic is pretty neat. I love the environmental look, even if the layouts of maps is pretty bare bones. The range of voices for the voice cast also surprised me. Made me think of Disgaea, which is a compliment. I've played too many games where all the voices are the same \\\"types.\\\"\\n\\nSome of the ideas used, such as characters all looking young even if they are fifty+ in age, because they are medicated to not age, is something I hadn't seen before. Kind of a hand wave, but a different one than usual, so that gets a thumbs up. Also the mental image of an old guy being mauled by giant cats.... which leads into a negative. It has a \\\"give token item to character to up relationship\\\" thing going, and while it works, I don't see much point in it as a concept. It is certainly better done than Musou games, or the last Fire Emblem game I played (haven't touched Three Houses), it isn't enough to stand out as a positive.\\n\\nAlso, I saw the tag Hack 'n Slash for the title. That doesn't fit. Certainly, you can spam attacks, but it fatally can't allow the player to break an attack chain by dodging. Enemies hit hard, and spamming attacks will be a short trip to game over. It is more of a dodge + counter system, with attacking between enemy attacks.\\n\\nI feel like some things were likely cut in the story boarding to give a \\\"good enough\\\" experience, and that is likely what my core issue is, then again, there are two story paths and I've only been playing one, so most of that may be a moot point, but the game loves to set up questions for strange things, and immediately throw something else at the player so that they may forget or at least, not resolve said thing before pushing the story along.

I got it cheap, and enjoyed it enough to finish it, but at $100 this game asks too much for what it provides. For less money, you can get Beyonetta, or for a little more money than Beyonetta, you can get Metal Gear Rising Revengence, or any of the \\\"Devil May Cry\\\" games that play infinitely better. If you are interested in a generic anime game with lots of clich\\u00e9s and a passable story told with a strange, cheap presentation, I would say get this game on sale at around $20, which is what I paid.\\n\\nOtherwise, [u]AVOID[/u].\\n\\nThe DLC is not worth it.\\n\\n[h1]----Summary[/h1]\\nScarlet Nexus is an anime hack and slash RPG with party members. You pick from one of two distinct characters and fight \\\"Others\\\" for the betterment of mankind. Each pickable character has a unique portion of the story, which is part of the greater story, kind of like Sonic Adventure 2. Sonic Adventure 2 also had a lot of weird issues that stopped it from being enjoyable all the way through, but I digress. I played as Yutio on normal difficulty.\\n\\n[h1]----Positives[/h1]\\n[h3]Good Graphics[/h3]\\nThis is a very good looking game and runs very well on my modest rig. I really like the way the clothes on the characters look, and there is some mocap in here. There is a caveat to this, so while I won't say this game looks bad, there is a huge issue with the presentation.\\n\\n[h3]English Voice Acting is Good[/h3]\\nHaving recently played a PS2 RPG with english voice acting, I can say that, with one exception for a character that shows up once, the english actors do a great job. It only took us, like, 20 years to get this far. \\n\\n[h3]Most of the Abilities are Interesting[/h3]\\nYou gradually acquire new abilities that change how you approach combat encounters. While a few of them overlap a little, their utility cannot be understated, especially when you have access to all of them.\\n\\n[h1]----Negatives[/h1]\\n[h3]Not Worth Full Price[/h3]\\nIt cannot be overstated that charging $100 for the \\\"full game\\\" or $60 for the the regular edition is too much. Do not pay full price. You can skip the DLC. Don't watch the anime either. Why isn't it worth full price?\\n\\n1. 90% of the cutscenes are \\\"visual novel codec calls\\\". You'd think from the advertising (and the $100 price tag) that all of the cutscenes would be fully animated, but no, there are so few animated cutscenes in game. Maybe you think \\\"I don't like cutscenes anyway\\\"; You still need to sit through the still images to understand anything. You might be rolling your eyes at me, but it feels very cheap, especially for a $100 game. There are tones of PS2 RPGs with better presentations. Also \\\"anime\\\" literally means \\\"animation\\\" in Japanese. Is it still an \\\"anime\\\" game if nothing moves?\\n2. The combat system is half baked\\n3. There is a lot of area re-use. Not as much as say, Hyperdimention Neptunia, but you will go to the same (admittedly nice looking) ice mountain area a few times.\\n4. the DLC they want you to buy is mostly worthless.\\n\\n[h3]Generic Anime Story[/h3]\\nI won't post spoilers, but you've seen this kind of plot before if you've watched any shonen anime. None of the characters are \\\"deep\\\". If you wanted to be in a shonen anime, this might be a plus for you. As for shonen anime, I recommend Cromartie Highschool.\\n\\n[h3]Tip Screens Won't Stop[/h3]\\nEvery new mechanic you encounter will freeze gameplay, and show you a tutorial. [b]EVERY.[/b] [b]SINGLE.[/b] [b]TIME.[/b] Then there are the constant popup reminders. Did you forget that you can teleport? Well just in case, 15% of the screen will be covered despite the fact you are already teleporting. There is no way to turn those off.\\n\\n[h3]Frustrating Combat System[/h3]\\nTL;DR: You will not be able to do [i]Smokin' Sick Style![/i] stunts like you do in DMC, Beyonetta, or even Godhand, and no amount of skill you have can change that.\\n\\nThe combat is the highlight of this game, if we are talking honestly. It's a bad combat system that is almost there, which makes it so maddening.  In this age, we should know how to make a good action combat system:\\n\\n* Small enemies get staggered by regular attacks\\n* Big enemies only get staggered by a finisher\\n* Enemies should have a clear windup to tell when they are attacking\\n* It should be [b]VERY[/b] clear at what point in the animation that the attack is going to hurt and when it can be dodged/parried\\n* If you have a dodge ability, it should be somewhat lenient in terms of movement, iframes and recovery frames\\n* Having a block button would be nice\\n* Regular attack combos should be snappy, and long animations should be reserved for risky moves/finishers\\n* Your dodge should be able to cancel out of most animations with recovery frames to compensate\\n* You probably shouldn't design high health/hard to hit enemies whos only purpose is to shoot projectiles at you off screen\\n* The tracking on enemy attacks shouldn't be obnoxious and impossible to dodge using your dodge move\\n* Your \\\"perfect dodge/parry\\\" mechanic should probably be easy and [u]consistent[/u] to trigger\\n* If you are going to have party members, they should probably do something\\n  \\nThis game struggles with all of these concepts. Devil May Cry and Kingdom Hearts 2 figured this out almost 20 years ago. Did I mention you can buy DMC 1-5 on steam right now for less money? \\n\\nIt was very clear that the game wasn't tested on normal difficulty because you go from \\\"this is no challenge\\\" to \\\"why isn't my regular combo breaking their shields anymore?\\\". This game gives you no real way of dealing with large crowds of enemies, and instead relies on ability spam, or leveling. There is no buyable skill or item that makes your dodge not worthless btw. Your combat animations are slow, dangerous, and unreliable. You have a launcher, but my air combos sometimes don't trigger, making me vulnerable and usually got me hit. Your teammates don't really do a whole lot; a far cry from something like FFXII or Xenoblade Chronicles.\\n\\nI could keep going, but this has to end.\\n\\n[h3]Anime Isn't Real Life[/h3]\\nI don't hate anime. I think I understand the demographic for this game, but this needs to be said. I have good friends, I am well liked at work, and am well trusted for my professional opinion. If you are looking to this game to show you what it's like, this game is not accurate. No one is ever going to want to filate you just for giving them a squash racket or a candle. I did these things because I wanted the gameplay benefits, but it concerns me that a good chunk of the game is screwing around with your shallow teammates doing inane things. At least there's no high school bull shit.\\n\\nI promise real friends are not like this.\\n\\n[h1]----Conclusion[/h1]\\nFor the $20 I spent on this game on sale, I don't feel that it wasted my time, but I am endlessly frustrated that the combat isn't as good as it should be for a game this modern. I don't really play modern games anymore, and I thought that given its premium price, this game might entice me more. It's a very pretty looking, generic game with an anime art style that had a story that held my attention long enough to see it to the end, but I don't want more. I've played free games that did so much more with so much less.  \\\"Charles Barkley Shut up and Jam: Gaiden Part 1\\\" has a more interesting story than Scarlet Nexus, and costs way less to boot.\\n\\nI stopped playing modern games because I felt that they were made to be easy, generic things to be discarded once you are done with them. Unfortunately, Scarlet Nexus certainly lives up to my opinion.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.3797782192509637, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Negative\", \"review_text\": \"i got this for discount and wanted to try it out, i love anime, and Tales of Arise is one of my favorite anime games ive played some of, but this game? no, not even if it was free would i play it again, id recommend against it if you love fluid combat game play, the animations and SFX look fantastic but they are keyed to your placement in repeating motions, NOT aimed in attacking an enemy like a floating blade bird thing should do, its got lock on but what good is it if you are not jumping and slinging at the same time, enemies move around nice, its all good and well, but fighting them was just an mental stress over load, im use to playing some darksouls on consoles, and even elden ring, im no pro but im not wet behind the ears in dodge timing, i was able to get perfect dodges a few times playing here but it was so off putting when it slowed you down, like why? im not bullet timing anything, theres no special benefit to slowmo me in a dodge, Fromsoft knows better, dont slow mo someone dodging, its jarring to deal with in combat, just give the I-Frames and let the combat flow best it can. and at the combat i tried to engage in was weak. fighting enemies with knock down stun locking was the worst thing for this, and if you dont go right for the skill to get back up when down you have to wait so long to get back up you could be hit AGAIN, and stunned AGAIN. what is with this kick to my face in combat. if you play elden ring like its a kids game to you, sure play this, but if you want to play an anime game thats casually fun or a little difficult to jostle your jimmies, dont play this, it will stress you out trying to combat 4 enemies that can stun lock you in the start of the game making it hard to engage at the start. and theres also the healing and market, nothing to say for its equipment but a weapon and 3 modules to give you a little edge, and then cosmetics so mediocre id rather waste my cash on whale bait games like vindictus or black desert. theres no long to the games story, the cut scenes are cut aways to picture plays that fly about the screen left and right, the effort to get you involved in the cut scenes is hard to find, and its not like they cant do decent cut scenes and put effort into animations and voices, they did great for that, but said screw it for cut scenes, and instead pitched it off to some middle rate graphics designer that took stills and just flick back and forth like an indie animation studio, and in the near start of the game, THEY DO ANIMATE A CUT SCENE LIKE MOMENT, theres talking matching mouth movement, they know how to do it but they instead mainly did picture cut scenes? why? why do they put effort into half the game like it doesnt really matter to them?

So, stripping away what \\\"seems like\\\" reward systems, you just fight through \\\"levels\\\" which are just a series of the same fight with 4-5 repeating enemies in each level, maybe 20 times, in the same areas which vary only in the specific shape of rectangular area, just smacking things repeatedly, and you'll inevitably unlock a slight increase to your damage, which won't matter because the enemies inn the next level have the same increase to their health pool, and so on...

I'll tell ya here in the short version before I go into detail, Scarlet Nexus is a game that revolves around two characters, both of which have their own story paths and dialogues, the game although slow to start picks up pace and becomes great fun! it also has two easier and harder modes for those of different skill levels, the story is interesting, same goes for the characters and I honestly highly suggest this game dood.\\n\\nStill around? here's the long detailed version of it, so Scarlet nexus is a game that revolves around people with powers and powers you most certainly get, combat due to this is extremely varied and interesting, at first it suffers a lot for most of the mechanics not really being open to you, this makes combat difficult and take a lot of time and items, it's not too hard granted but I fear this will offput people trying it out and I honestly urge those who see this review to give it a real go dood.\\n\\nSkills are earned two ways, you have your skill tree which you get points for when you level, these vary in having a few good things, some not all that great but they all expand how you fight, the other is through friendship which to me is both a great and important aspect of the game on many levels, as you grow your friendship the powers and their effects expand to some great degrees, making you a real force to be reckoned with and they quite frankly look great too dood.\\n\\nThat said the protagonists powers are a little...different, now granted they can be powerful sure with the right things lying around but the base attack is honestly rather poor overall, which is a shame, if they were going to do that I would have rathered they make the normal ability free and the need to build up meter for the more impressive attacks, it wasn't the worst mind you but it certainly took a really cool ability and made it less than it could have been overall because of it dood.\\n\\nThis game is heavily story based, which I feel is a good thing, if you allow for it you will learn to love the characters for how unique they are and their own stories in the world, they also have their own bond episodes even, that said make no mistake this doesn't make the game short, for an action game even without the story stuff it's a long game with interesting and satisfying fights, some of which will feel like puzzles even as you learn enemies weaknesses and the best way to tackle them dood.\\n\\nThere's a lot of fun visual details in the game, particularly with gifts making them extra fun to actually give, I won't spoil exactly why but the devs put a whole lot into this and I appreciate that more than they will ever know, the music is also great, I do suggest going into settings though, they have the sounds down half way, which actually is another thing I appreciate, too many devs have everything set to max at the get go XD not great if it's a loud game dood.\\n\\nFinal notes okay yeah so there is a single thing that would have been nice, I mean I figured it out in the end but weirdly I avoided it so long due to me thinking and it showing that it was an anti air attack that I never thought to use the A and X button rise attack on ground enemies, this really reaaally helped on medium or lower enemies that didn't stagger, especially early on as effectively it took an enemy down for a little so they weren't attacking dood.\\n\\nOther than that there's nothing else to say, the game in my eyes does so much right, could it be better? yes like most games, certain refining like damage from certain enemies being lowered just a smidge or the missions rankings not being quite so harsh would be nice (To note I played on normal and there were a couple of enemies that had attacks that could right out K.O you if you weren't careful) and of course that start is a rough one but outside of that if you give this game a chance it shouldn't disappoint and in fact give you more than your moneys worth by far in content and fun times, thanks for reading dood! ^-^7\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.009415790761778182, \"joke\": 1, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Decent game, was worth my time\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.03883246802089042, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Just over 10 hrs in right now, and I am loving it.

But I feel like I understand enough to give it a review. The story isn't great, it's not bad. It's typical anime style story. The characters are all interesting in their own way. I am not a huge fan of the new age character trope of girls fawning over the protagonist, in this case Yuito. I understand why devs do it these days, so the guys playing can have characters that have that romantic connection with their player character. Yadda, yadda. But outside of that they are all pretty interesting and have neat designs.\\n\\nThe combat is quite fun. It's not amazing but it's fun. It seems like both main characters have the same powers, probably for story fight purposes. But part of me wishes we got to use other abilities in the game. But maybe a sequel will let us use a different ability. Not to say the one we get in game is bad. Just feels like there's potential for a lot of fun varying gameplay.\\n\\nMy biggest gripe is probably the visual novel style it has for most cutscenes. It's not a visual novel game obviously there is gameplay. But for most of the game's story portions it's a visual novel style where you see stills/pictures of characters talking and interacting and it kinda makes the story feel lifeless for me personally. If there is a sequel I really hope they do away with that. Feels tacky and lame. And if I paid full price I for sure probably would have refunded this game. Full price game and the cutscenes are for the most part visual novel style? No thank you.\\n\\nOverall it's an enjoyable game. I paid 40 dollars for the game and all the DLC and for 40 dollars I feel I got my moneys worth. Neat characters, neat enough story, neat combat.

It feels like a linear action game where everything RPG related has been slapped on top as an afterthought. Combat is fun and engaging, but everything else feels so tiresome to a point where I don't want to continue playing after exiting a combat and being booted into the hub.\\n\\n\\n[h1]Combat(8/10)[/h1]\\nIt's a decent combat system, but nothing mindblowing. You've got your generic combo attacks, a \\\"special\\\" move (really not special), and 2 telekinesis attacks. You also get access to allies which modify those attacks a bit, by adding some effect (like elemental damage or increased stagger) to them. The game allows you to combo most of these things somewhat seamlessly. Combat feels good when it works.\\n\\nWhile in missions where combat takes place, I always wanted to continue playing.\\n\\n[b]Combat negatives[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] EVERYTHING in combat feels broken (bad broken) until you get upgrades for it. You run out of energy fast; you can't recover from being knocked down (happens), you can't dodge in air (even if you see the attack coming 2 seconds ahead of time, you don't recover energy quick. Getting skills from skill tree feels like restoring combat to the default state, rather than getting upgrades.\\n[*] Another huge negative for me is not being able to cancel attacks. I'll make this one short. If you're fighting more than 2 enemies you'll inevitably get attacked while attacking one of them. You will see that attack coming, but will have no tools to counteract it because you're locked in an animation. \\n[*] Combat doesn't evolve in any meaningful way outside of you restoring the \\\"broken\\\" skills to default state. I mean it does evolve a little, but those are tiny tactical options rather than anything that would change how you play.\\n[/list]\\n\\n\\n[h1]Presentation (8/10)[/h1]\\nOverall, music and visuals are a pretty good fit for the theme the game is going for. \\n\\nWhat I didn't like was comics style fully voiced cutscenes, that freeze gameplay, to portray characters standing and talking. This could have been a dialogue that plays in the background without interrupting gameplay.  Don't get me wrong, dialogues look stylistically nice and have some effects that show work was put into them. With all that said 9 times out of 10 they serve no purpose and add to the tedium of non-mission gameplay.\\n\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay(4/10)[/h1]\\nIf combat encounters kept me going without thinking, everything outside combat had me questioning why I am still playing. \\nTutorial 1 tedious mission with like 8 enemies and lots of textwall tutorials. Modern games simply display button prompts on the side instead of giving you a pop-up with a page of text to explain how basic movement works.\\n\\nThe actual gameplay outside of combat feels very bland if you don't rush the story (which places you into combat more). You're basically shifting between city (hub) and mission areas. The city is a functionally empty place. It's filled with NPCs and cars and stuff, but there's nothing for you to interact with outside of occasional special NPC that gives you a side quest (fetchquests).\\n\\nThe story that takes place in the city pretty much has you run to a specific location to show you a cutscene in comic style dialogue. Often times the dialogue/story has nothing to do with the place you were just told to run to.\\n\\nIn mission areas you're basically running a corridor narrow. You can enter a side room or 2, but they rarely properly reward you for doing so. I mean you usually find SOMETHING, but I am yet to find an item I am excited for. Pretty much all early loot makes no sense. Example: \\\"<something> district A\\\".... am I meant to be excited for this? Is this good? This is the 12th time I get it, I'm not sure what to do with all that garbage (spoiler: it's a material for other boring items).\\n\\n\\n[h1]Progression(5/10)[/h1]\\nClearly an afterthought. If I had to describe what character progression feels like, I would say they designed an action combat and then started ripping features out to \\\"sell\\\" through a skill tree. It's one of those rare games where I felt something was off the moment I started playing and as I was investing skill points the discomfort in combat faded away.\\n\\nAbout 20% of skills are boring stat buffs, 60% feel like they belong in baseline (things like ability to dash mid-air, or dash-attack mid-air once you get access to dash) and remaining 20% are the skills that actually feel like upgrades (stuff like energy recovery on perfect dodge).\\n\\nFor equipment you have weapons, which are 100% linear progression 3 damage increase per chapter.\\nYou also get accessories, which give some variety, but not too much, because there are like 20 options, 3 slots and and maybe only 6 real choices to consider.\\n\\n[h1]DLCs (1/10)[/h1]\\nI'll just just say I'm glad I got them for free (cheap bundle, not really free). If the entire pack of DLCs costs you more than 3$ check a youtube video or something to see what you're paying for.\\n3/4 DLC costumes look like basic color swaps with default costumes ON ALL CHARACTERS. I really had to pay attention to notice those 3 stripes vanishing as I shifted between DLC and default.\\n\\nAccessories look like meme items and most of them feel out of place. \\n\\nEverything else is stuff you can earn in game.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.06391254970886445, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"after 45 hours of playing scarlet nexus, here is my 2 cents.\\n\\nthe game story is above average/every character develop across the gameplay, you get to know more about each character with bond episodes and are even rewarded for that.\\nnothing earth shuttering or revolutionary, but the story was interesting and made me come for more.\\nI didn't like that the game has 2 characters to play with and that you need to play with both of them if you want to understand the whole story, that said this is the only game I actually played both pathes.\\nI just really wanted to find out what happend to Naomi and how and when Kasane changed her mind, but after the first 15 hours of the second gameplay you don't find out anything new and the story is just the same for both pathes.\\ncharacters design was really good, imo, every main character was recognizable.\\n\\n\\nthe gameplay/combat system was really good, it felt pretty fluied and fresh the whole game, with diffrent SAS that was at your disposal at diffrent stages of the game,\\nnew techniques to buy on the brain map, or just new skills you got from the bond episodes.\\nthe only minus is that around half point in the game you don't really see new enemies, but you never really feel it, even after 2 gameplays.\\n\\n\\ngraphics where really good imo, it looks like a colorful game that will hold it ground in the coming years.\\ni played on max setting and on 1440P on amd rx5700 and ryzen 7 2700 and the game looked really good and i never felt any lags.\\nthe environment doesn't look doll imo, everything keeps feeling fresh.\\nThe character design was really good, imo, every main character was recognizable.\\n\\nthe music was decent, not bad but nothing revolutionary, i won't keep listening to it  but even after 2 playthroughs it never felt taxing.\\n\\n\\noverall I don't think it is a super memorable game, it was super fun and i did enjoy it, but i won't play it again, 2 playthroughs are enogh in this case.\\nas someone that like a story-heavy jRPG games i really liked and enjoyed the game , and i do reccomend you to buy it, you should play at least 1 playthrough, if you do plan to play just 1 playthrough i reccomend you to play with kasene\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.05618296419623553, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"The female protagonist is really cool\\uff0cand the scene where she executes the monster is quite stylish and impressive\\u3002what\\u2018 s even better is that the addition\\nof yuri elements .what a fantastic game!\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.04627347549654495, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"fun\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.00832275443608523, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Negative\", \"review_text\": \"nah\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.28585410890675067, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"This game is an absolute treat from start to finish.

It starts slowly, with your usual weapon attacks and combos, but the more you play the game and form bonds with other characters in your group, the more it opens up. Soon they will be able to block damage for you, perform special attacks in certain combat situations and even lend you their powers over a system called \\\"SAS\\\". This system is the main drive of combat as you use it to borrow someone else's power, perform special combo visions and turn the fight in your favour.\\n\\nFighting in Scarlet Nexus is pretty damn fun and even on Hard it always felt like a fair challenge. You can play through the game with both Yuito and Kasane, though I am warning you: to get specific achievements and play the game the \\\"intended\\\" way, you have to start the new character on the same savefile that you finished the old one on.

The gameplay in battle is smooth and it has good animations in it, you can enjoy the battle and think about a strategy in your own way. I use a strategy in battle with 1 jump, pressing C and perform the dubbel jump to the left or right.\\nIt has middle to low requirements on some pc's. You can also choose the difficulty of the game: Easy, middle, hard and very hard. If you are new i recommend Yuito on easy mode. Because Yuito is much easier to play then Kasane.\\n\\nThe negative:\\n\\nIt's annoying if you get hit by enemies and almost never get a perfect dodge. It is also annoying if the lock-on (Focusing on enemies) is enabled while you don't want to. Always focusing on enemies is not good you get hit my other enemies on the field. The storyline is fun but it could has more fights/challenges in it. Plus more free walking in the map you're in. About to exit the game, you get lost how to get out of the game. But here is a few tips.\\n\\nTips:\\n\\n- Use the C butten more than attack. It is only necessary if you need more damage, and if you use a power like electric.\\n\\n- Use the shield power if you use G button object, you get less damage from the enemies.\\n\\n- If you unlock double jump, use 1 jump and use C button 1 time and quickly use jump 2 to the left or the right.\\n\\n- Run around the monsters so much as possible, attacking to much with multiple monsters will result more damage then attacking less and run more. I recommend use C when the purple bar is low.\\n\\n- Use G button object when the enemy is down or when shield power is activated. I recommend use the shield when there are multiple enemies.\\n\\n- Learn what ther attacks are. Like the first boss it shoots 1 bullet, when the HP reached to half it shoots 3 bullets instead of 1. \\n\\n- Yuito is much easier to play then Kasane i only recommendt his to beginners.\\n\\n - Remove lock-on by pressing Q. To activate it is too press it again.\\n\\n- To exit the game press ECS, go to settings, the go to others in settings and rhe you see the exit. It returns you to the homescreen and you can exit the game.\\n\\nI love the game/Anime and i wished that there was Scarlet Nexus 2.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.05494094652287708, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Don't try to use your brain to understand the story.\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.03763911453056802, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Negative\", \"review_text\": \"Almost every chapter/phase: \\n\\n- After the big fight: We defeated the opposing faction, we should capture or kill them...\\n- Opposing faction: stands up like nothing happened.

There are two playable characters that you pick between at the beginning of the game, each with their own story. The stories will sometimes intersect, but they are largely different. It would have been better to combine the stories into one, in which you swap perspectives as you go. Instead, by playing both stories separately, you are forced to play many of the same areas multiple times (which you already backtrack to during just one playthrough). The final act is also mostly the same between the two stories, so you'll likely be skipping everything by then.\\n- Little sense of adventure. On top of the backtracking problem, most of the places you go aren't all that interesting in the first place.\\n- Extremely bloated writing. Way too much exposition near the end of the game.\\n- Bad enemy variety. You are likely to be burnt out on combat by the end of just one route.\\n- Yuito is an ultra generic main character, especially in his own route.\\n- Way too many tutorials.\\n- Questionable UI design.

Scarlet Nexus is a fantastic Action RPG that requires you to play as two separate protagonists to fully understand the full story. Being that this is an RPG, this review is gonna be a lengthy read so for TL:DR: This is one of the best Action RPGs I have ever played. Great combat and gameplay. AMAZING characters and bonding experiences. Superb soundtrack, lots of fun visual customization and crafting. I highly recommend it. Now for the rest of you, let's dig in.\\n\\nOn Earth, there's this dangerous fog-like mass known as the Extinction Belt. This belt is made of this mysterious source called Other Particles. These create monsters called Others that basically cause problems around the world. To combat these Others, the OSF has been created to help fight against them. The OSF is filled with people who have abilities known as psionics. They have a bunch of different abilities like fire, ice, teleporting, etc. You get to choose between two new recruits, Kasane and Yuito. Both of them are joining the OSF for different reasons, but they both have the same power, psychokinesis (lifting objects with their mind). Little do they know, they are both connected by something huge. Something that will change the world....or doom it.\\n\\nAs stated before, Scarlet Nexus is an Action RPG. You'll be hitting enemies with attacks with your main weapon while also having the ability to hurl nearby objects at them with you psychokinesis. Most objects will just do plain damage as you just smack enemies in the face with them and some have special animations. The special ones take longer to grab, leaving you open to attack, but will come with a bonus QTE attack that will do extra damage. Combat is fast and fluid, and different enemies require different ways of approach. This is where SAS comes in.\\n\\nSAS is the system that connects you with your party members. Since everyone is a psionic, SAS allows you to temporarily borrow their powers in combat. This enhances combat as you want to use the optimal strategy to knock enemies out and keep your damage up. See an enemy covered in water? Borrow Shiden's electricity and you do bonus damage AND can stun that enemy. Is there an enemy that's cloaked or duplicating? Use Tsugumi's clairvoyance to see through the enemy's tricks and knock them out. There are so many different abilities and each party member's abilities comes in handy at all times which makes the combat such a joy to play. As the game progresses, you'll gain access to finishers, an enhanced mode where you do more damage called Brain Drive, and the temporary Godlike mode known as Brain Field in which you do massive damage, but if you stay in the mode too long, you die and get game over. Sounds like a lot, but the game introduces all these concepts slowly so it never feels overwhelming.\\n\\nYour party members can do so much more than just allow you to borrow their powers in combat. If you grow closer to them and deepen your bonds, you will unlock more abilities. You can borrow their powers for a longer period of time, they will occasionally block damage for you, you can have them extend your combos, and more. The characters are one of the best strengths about this game and the place where it truly shines is the Hideout. This is the place where you go in between story beats and during this phase you can craft, buy, and give presents to your party members. The more you use the party member's ability and presents you give them raise their bond with you and this unlocks new things. It also helps you learn more about them and each one has a great backstory. What I also love is the gifts you give are not just cosmetic things that just disappear. Each gift turns into a decoration inside the hideout and you will see the party members actually use them as well. This was one of my all time favorite touches in the game. I especially love when you certain party members want the same gift because when you give them all the gift, it becomes a new interaction they all take party in. For example, I had 3-4 party members who wanted a tea set. After giving each one the tea set, every so often when I go to the Hideout, all 4 of them will be sitting in the kitchen drinking tea together. THAT is how you make players care about characters and I commend and praise the developers for making so many fun and great animations around the Hideout to make it so awesome.\\n\\nAnother thing I must praise in this game is the look and music. I loved the towns and exploring dungeons. What's more fun is how you can use party member's abilities outside of combat as well to find secrets and progress. Teleport past walls, or use electricity to open electric doors. The map making, while very corridor-y, was fun to explore. The music was amazing too. What I especially love is that the music has multiple versions. There's the exploration version, then the battle version, and then a speedy and trippy battle version when you enter brain drive mode. It was fun to listen to and kept me into the battle all the time. The story was quite enjoyable as well. I like the visual novel style they used for dialogue, but I can understand how some players might be turned off by it. No...there is no romance options in this game (lol).\\n\\nBefore we get to the gripe section I also want to praise the game for it's customization. You can unlock, craft, and buy lots of pieces of visual equipment to add to all your party members. From shades, cat ears, backpacks, visors, masks, etc. There was so much to choose from and each character can wear 3 different pieces. The only thing to watch out for is that these will show up in cut scenes and if they are wearing something flashy or bulky like wings, it will block things and you may miss something. Just be mindful of that.\\n\\nOkay, now for gripes. My biggest issue with this game was the side quest system. It was totally lame and honestly not needed. All side quests were was \\\"Hey, beat up this enemy using this type of move or ability X amount of times.\\\" Unless you are going for %100 completion, they are totally unnecessary as I never found myself needing to grind in this game, ever. The other thing that was annoying was the constant repeating from your operator about getting hit by status effects. The first few times, cool, but when I'm 20 hours into the game and I hear \\\"Hey, be careful, getting oil will make you susceptible to fire attacks.\\\" I just wanna shout \\\"I KNOW!!!!\\\". There's no way to turn it off and it's just ear grating after a while. I do like it when team mates suggest to use their abilities to tackle certain enemies however, THAT, was helpful at least.\\n\\nFinal verdict? If it isn't apparent already, I though this game was a masterpiece. I had no bugs or anything in my playthrough. I thought the playtime was a perfect length as I finished both campaigns in about 40-50 hours. The new game plus made it easier to blaze through the story until I got to the parts where the protagonists split up and got to see what the other one was doing. I absolutely loved hanging around the Hangout and learning more about all the party members and at the end of the game I really felt close to all of them. I can't stress enough that if you're looking for a fun Action RPG to play, this is one you don't wanna miss. The regular $60 is a bit much to ask for so I suggest waiting for it to go on sale. It's worth a solid $20-30 in my honest opinion.

I wasn't expecting much from Takumi Miyajima, as his scenarios with me have been fairly hit and miss. But this time, he's knocked it out of the park. A combination of grim setting and compelling characters tied into an interesting central mystery make this story very intriquing. When you're playing as Kasane. When you're in Yuito's shoes, the plot's a lot more generic and uninteresting. You have to play both sides to get the whole story, but I'd start with Kasane's first as it's the more compelling and non-standard of the two. Supporting cast and antagonists on both sides are strong, and only grow deeper if you go into their Bond Episodes, especially with the piece of dialogue that appear during exploration.\\n\\nGameplay is really fun, though rather limited in the beginning. It's on the surface a basic action system with clear DNA from the Tales series, but there's so much more depth given by the use of psionic powers. From the two leads' psychokinesis, to electricity and fire control, to invisibility and clairvoyance, there's a descent range of abilities that with one exception aren't mutually exclusive, and are necessary to use against the Other enemies if you don't want the game to degenerate into a slog. The best way to play is zipping around the map, wielding your powers and weapons to lay waste to all. There's plenty of layered mechanics, such as the Brain Crush ability, the role of accessories, the Brain Field super state, exploration in some areas.\\n\\nThere is one thing that's more than a little frustrating in places, and that's the side quests. It's not as bad as 'kill x number of enemies to win', as they vary this up with needing to use a specific power or move (some only unlocked by progressing a character's Bond to a specific level), or meet certain conditions while exploring. These are varied, and help you better understand the various powers, but some of these side quest objectives are...frustrating. It's made more so by the fact that enemies don't respawn unless you leave the area entirely, not just a different zone but a different 'dungeon'. The first time I ran into this was with the quest 'Environmentalism'. Trust me, this will have you tearing your hair out.\\n\\nVisually, this is a nice balance of standard anime styling and a new direction born from this 'brainpunk' setting and aesthetic. The cutscenes are okay (though the anime opening's not to my taste), mostly using comic-style stills sparsely broken up with full motion sections. It's all in real-time, so if you want to accessorise you character, you can have truly tragic scenes play out while a character wears a cake hat. Yeah, the humour in Scarlet Nexus is very...anime game. The audio is also very good, and I give solid props to the English dub which was bearable and mostly enjoyable on all fronts. The music by Hayata Takeda is incredible in all areas. Literally there is no track that gets boring to listen to, and the dynamic music shifting between exploration and combat for several areas is killer. Highlights are the Abandoned Subway and Construction Site themes, and the Seiran theme. The only track I don't like is the opening theme, which isn't be Takeda.\\n\\nOn a technical front, the game runs great on my Windows 10 PC. Everything runs mostly at 60 fps, and I didn't feel the need to adjust the settings, and there's no real clipping anywhere which kept the immersion. I did experience one crash to desktop when pressing too many buttons at once, and wearing accessories on characters both lengthens load times and can cause frame stutters when exploring (thankfully not in combat). There was also a point where a character portrait vanished, and several points where the subtitles don't match the dub or have formatting issues, but these are nitpicks.\\n\\nI don't have the DLC, and don't want the DLC, so I can't comment.\\n\\nOn the whole, this is an incredible package. I'm so glad I played this, and I'd be positively eager for a sequel to this. The setting and characters, the plot, the gameplay, the graphics and especially the music are all top notch. The main issues I felt were uneven writing between the campaigns, the side quests could get frustrating at times, and there are some technical issues here and there. Bandai Namco Studios and Tose have done incredible work, and all I have to say is... Take your time with Scarlet Nexus 2 so it can be just as good, if not better, than this one.\\n\\n9/10.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.5122485955050813, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Scarlet Nexus is pretty good as far as hack and slash goes and I'd rate it on par with the DMC series.\\n\\nFirst and most importantly this game has everything you would expect from a high quality hack and slash game. With these types of games you absolutely need responsive controls and the camera needs to be on it's best behaviour at all times. Scarlet Nexus does this pretty well, the jumping, dashing and attacks are all very responsive. This game adds a layer of strategy which I'll talk about later, but for now the game doesn't let you cancel out of attacks. This is intentional and it actually forces you to stay on your toes and think before committing to an all out assault, which you will definitely need to do.\\n\\nThe camera is pretty good at positioning itself in safe areas where you can see what's going on. Unlike the DMC series, this camera wants to be behind you which isn't a problem 90% of the time. The other 10% is nothing to do with the camera controls or positioning, it's to do with the lock on system. 1v1 tactical fights are no problem because you don't need to see everything or change targets but it can be a problem in some situations when you're being swarmed.\\n\\nFortunately and this is best part, this game loves its PC users. There are tonnes of options to help fine tune the camera and lock on systems so you'll be able to control the fighting a lot easier. These options aren't limited to camera and button input, there are advanced graphical options which a lot of games released for console and PC seem to be lacking.\\n\\nAs I mentioned earlier there is a strategic layer to this game and it comes from borrowing the powers of your allies. They're really fun to use and as you level yourself up and unlock the ability to use more at the same time the game really takes off and makes you feel god-like. The strategy layer seamlessly changes the pace of the game from hacking and slashing through groups of weak enemies to having souls-like 1v1 fights against tougher enemies. The enemies are designed to be beaten with the aid of your allies powers but also breaking the enemy down to expose its weakspots. To help you do this allies will call out to you in battle and there is an encyclopedia built into the game with additional info such as item drops.\\n\\nThis game has really high quality user-friendly features. Your allies don't just call out if their power would work better, they also call out enemies you encounter and items you need which are part of side-quests you've taken. Once accepted you can look up the quest in the pause menu at any time and if you have the items on you the mission can be completed from the same menu. This means you only have to accept a side-quest once and never need to speak to the NPC again. The game does a good job of lightening the load so you can focus on progression instead of running back and forth to finish up quests.\\n\\nIf you haven't noticed from the media on the store page, this is the same engine that was used for Tales of Arise. Make no mistake Scarlet Nexus is completely free-roam and more so than DMC. You don't jump into instances like in ToA. What the engine does bring to the table is the skits and relationship building that you see in the Tales of series. It adds so much depth to the characters by giving them personality, hobbies, interests, backstories etc.\\n\\nLast thing to note is that Scarlet Nexus uses a two-sided story system and you'll be locked into your chosen character until the end of the game. Once cleared you can play as the other character and carry over all your gear and levels. once you complete both stories a merged save will be created that allows you to switch main character at will and retain everything from both playthroughs. If I haven't said it enough, the game is very user friendly. I would recommend the DLC too because they offer some pretty awesome end-game battles.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.38342719848221596, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Negative\", \"review_text\": \"Good:\\n- Nice combat ( like devil may cry, but repetitive tho )\\n- Nice music\\nBad:\\n- talk too much\\n- generic story\\n- no animated cut scene\\n- It is like manga with voice over ( visual novel )\\n- stupid MC ( male )\\n- Male mc is simp.

My first JRPG and Anime Game, it made a strong first impression, but is not without flaws. \\n\\nYou play as one of two characters in the game. Yuito, a nice guy who comes from a rich and powerful corrupt family and yields a sword, or Kasane, a lone wolf whose love and loyalty lies to her sister and uses knives.  Each of them use psychokinesis, and can control objects around them, interacting with the environment which makes for fun, unique gameplay and combat. You fight monsters called Others, but I'm gonna call them monsters because calling them Others makes me feel like an idiot. The beginning of the game feels a bit stale with lots of exposition and talking and explaining but once you reach the second phase [spoiler]and head for the underground subway where one of the girls gets shot[/spoiler] the story really starts to pick up and gets really good. Along with psychokinesis, you can control many other powers with the SAS, an elemental system where you can borrow abilities used by your friends, and it feels really good to use. \\n\\nAnd speaking of your friends, they are a huge selling point for the game. Each of them are unique and different but I can't help but point out that some of them feel like an anime stereotype. \\n\\n[list] [b] Yuito Platoon [/b]\\n\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0[*]\\ud83d\\udd25 Hanabi: Yuito's childhood friend and good natured girl. He's also her love interest and why do you have to be so oblivious and blind Yuito? She yields Pyrokinesis, controlling fire and can burn enemies giving them damage over time. She's the best waifu and girl. \\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0[*]\\ud83d\\udd28 Luka: A small guy who I mistook for a girl the first time I saw him until I heard his voice. He is very committed to exercise and is overshadowed by his big brother and other people. He holds the power of teleportation and can instantly move to any open space. He also uses a giant hammer in combat which is pretty cool. \\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0[*]\\ud83d\\udc41 Tsugumi: The shy, quiet girl who should still be taken seriously if she considers you a threat. Really likes plants, like a lot, to the point where I'm surprised her power wasn't chlorokinesis. It is actually Clairvoyance, and she can see through smoke and invisibility. \\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0[*] \\ud83d\\udc1a Gemma: The brute. The tank. He's the big guy is what I'm saying. He's an old veteran who lost his purpose in life and is looking for a new one, as all he knows is fighting. His power is Sclerokinesis, where he can prevent damage from any incoming attack for a short duration.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[list] [b] Kasane Platoon [/b]\\n\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0[*]\\ud83d\\udc69 Kyoka: The team mom. Both inside and out. She sees all of her comrades as family and treats many of them like her own kids. She's as pretty as she is overprotective. Inside she's a momma bear, outside she's a [spoiler]\\u00a0MILF. Like wow[/spoiler]. She possesses Duplication, and can copy herself and any other object. She also uses dual crossbows, which adds to her coolness. \\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0[*]\\u26a1\\ufe0fShiden: Is introduced as a major \\u00e1sshole in the beginning, and kills team morale by being a jerk. But is later revealed to be a male Tsundere through bonding and later chapters, which I admit I didn't see coming. He ends up being one of the most valuable members of the team. He uses Electrokinesis, and can control lightning and electricity. \\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0[*]\\ud83d\\udc30 Arashi: A celebrity loli (she's actually at least 30 years old) in the city the game takes place in, she is in reality brilliant but lazy. And when I say lazy, I really mean lazy. There is nothing she hates more than wasted energy or time. She's still extremely valuable to the team and is often the smartest one in the game and she can hold her own and fight if she's serious. She's really hard for anyone to dislike. Also for some reason really likes soda and cola and is the face of a cola brand called Cohla. Ironically holds the power of Hypervelocity, and can go so fast that time appears to slow down. She also uses a freakin chainsaw for a weapon, calm down Arashi!   \\n  \\n    [*]\\ud83c\\udf7a Kagero: One of the older members of the team, he's a playboy teasing party animal who likes to have a good time and won't let you do the opposite. Has a dark past that he tries to hide by doing that. He has Invisibility, which is pretty self explanatory, he can turn invisible and do a very powerful backstab to go with it. \\n\\n[/list]\\n\\nUsing your friends, learning about them and fighting with them is half the fun. You can bond with them during bond episodes, which help you learn more about them and makes their powers stronger. You can also give them gifts which also increases their bond level. You and your friends stay at the hideout, which is basically a hangout apartment for them. \\n\\nYou can play the game in either English or Japanese, but I personally played in English since there is a lot of talking in combat and you can't always read it. The Graphics are really good, and its nice to be able to customize it to appeal to you. The gameplay felt extremely easy at times but also gave a really good challenge especially on the hardest difficulty. \\n\\nIt's not perfect though and isn't without flaws. The quests kinda suck, and they shouldn't even really exist because there's no point in doing them. Even if you wanted to do it just to do it they make them frustrating by not showing you where to go. You're really playing more for the story than the quests. And speaking of the story, if you don't like stories that have animated boxes and slides, you'll probably get bored really quick because it has a lot of that, usually after you reach the objective, often more than actual animated scenes. I didn't mind it, but I can see how someone else would. \\n\\nOverall I recommend Scarlet Nexus to anyone, including weebs and single player lovers. If it's on sale, give it a shot. Story is good, gameplay and combat is great, and the characters are unique and likable. If it's your first Anime JRPG, like it was mine, grab it and consider yourself lucky. I'm excited to see what's in store for the future, maybe Scarlet Nexus 2? \\ud83d\\ude4f Please Bandai Namco.\\n\\n[b] Final Score [/b]\\n\\n[table]\\n    [tr]\\n        [th]Category[/th]\\n        [th]Score[/th]\\n    [/tr]\\n    [tr]\\n        [td]Story[/td]\\n        [td]7 Design Children (7/10)[/td]\\n    [/tr]\\n    [tr]\\n        [td]Gameplay[/td]\\n        [td]8 Others (8/10)[/td]\\n    [/tr]\\n    [tr]\\n        [td]Characters[/td]\\n        [td]9 Bottles of Cola (9/10)[/td]\\n    [/tr]\\n    [tr]\\n        [th]Overall[/th]\\n        [th]8 Bakis (8/10)[/th]\\n    [/tr]\\n[/table]\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.04304602914959363, \"joke\": 1, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"completed the main story in 28 hours and have fallen in love with the game, definitly worth the purchase\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.33569491262235973, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"This game sucks.\\n\\n*Combat*\\nTHIS GAME TREATS YOU LIKE A 2 YEAR OLD WHO HAS NEVER PLAYED A RPG IN THEIR LIFE. I DO NOT NEED TO BE REMINDED THAT I WILL GET ELECTROCUTED IF I GET ATTACKED WITH WATER AND THAT I WILL BURN IF I GET ATTACKED WITH GASOLINE.\\nFor all it's worth, I really like the SAS gimmick, but the game does not get any harder than it is the first time you boot it up. There's no new mechanics, they literally just throw around enemies with more HP. \\nYou press three buttons, that's it. I'm not even kidding. Square, Triangle and Circle (X, Y and B). That is the extent of this games' physical combat.\\n\\n\\n\\n*Level Design*\\nThe game has an extremely boring, linear level design. \\nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with linear level design, if done correctly. Just look at games like Persona 5 or even Final Fantasy XIV dungeons.\\nThe level design in Scarlet Nexus is so soul-less and dull, I finished this game one day ago and cannot remember anything unique.\\n\\n*World Building*\\nTHERE IS ABSOLUTELY *ZERO* WORLD BUILDING. People have powers, alright how did they get them?, What is the origin of those powers? Who is the first person who had powers?\\nThere's also people without powers, so called \\\"duds\\\". Why don't they have powers?\\nHow did humanity somewhat merge with technology?\\nAt the start of the game, Kasane (One of the games' protagonists) receives access to this thing called \\\"Bias\\\". People who use it too much go insane or something similar. THIS \\\"BIAS\\\" THING IS NEVER MENTIONED AGAIN.\\n\\n\\n\\n*Party Members and Characters*\\nI actually really like the games' party members and their designs. If you do the bond episodes you can really see them grow and develop, but they are so god-damn trusting it truly hurts my brain and sometimes this game gets really illogical.\\nThere are no bond episodes for your operators, Haruka and Wataru, despite them being in your hideout, which for me was really disappointing because they definitely had potential.\\nMy game was glitched so my team's bond level would not go past bond level one, despite having done all my bond episodes so I wasn't able to do the 6th bond episode for any party member.\\nOne thing that really annoyed me is the fact that there are 9 party members, but you can only use 8 powers. LIKE HOW HARD WOULD IT HAVE BEEN TO PUT IN 1 MORE BUTTON!\\nAlso a lot of characters get introduced and just thrown away in the bin with maybe 10-15 minutes of screen-time.\\nKodama and Seto are great examples of this.\\n\\n\\n\\n*Graphics/Artstyle and Soundtrack*\\nThe game's artstyle is really good and visually pleasing. You don't need a NASA SUPER-COMPUTER to run it either (looking at you, final fantasy xv)\\nIt's just a shame that the level designs weren't good enough to take advantage of this game's art style.\\n\\nThe soundtrack is really... Forgettable. Like really forgettable. I cannot remember a single track except the final boss theme, which comes no where close to 'Weight of the World' or  'Keep your Faith'.\\n\\n\\n\\n*Final Thoughts*\\nAt 30 hours to beat, 60h for both protagonists, Scarlet Nexus is... alright. It's definitely not the best JRPG of all time or neither is it trying to be. But it's fun. It's a good story. I'm not a big fan of the physics, especially since your power is psychokinesis.\\nI'm gonna give this game a thumbs up, because I think more people should play it.

My opinion on my recommendation hasn't changed.  Leveling seems rather pointless as Attack/Power/Defense boosts from upgraded gear don't feel meaningful.  If anything, you're just trying to keep up at the speed of plot.  Not once in this game have I had that feeling of being powerful against rank and file enemies even when I out leveled them by 5-10 levels.  Boss fights drag on and are stupid boring.  So far they require a repetitive set of actions just to deal damage.  And, unlike you, they can ACTUALLY deal meaningful amounts of damage to you despite a level difference.  Even in the Brain Field/Drive.\\n\\nI'm still going to finish the game; however, the game stopped being fun 10 hours ago (into it).  \\n\\nRight off the bat, I'll finish the game.  I'm glad I bought it for only $18.00 on sale.  Otherwise, I'd be insanely pissed.\\n\\nFor $18? It's a great rip off of other Bandai games: music, art, gameplay.\\n\\nAside from that? The music is straight gutted from Persona 4/5. Not necessarily a bad thing on its' own with some creative flair in the melody, right?  This sounds like they straight lifted it form the games up and to including the vocalization riffs.\\n\\nThe skill progression as the \\\"Brain Map\\\" is interesting.  Kind of like a Devil May Cry standard that upgrades unlock new abilities and utility slots.  At the time of this post and at level 25, you get 2 \\\"brain points\\\" per level.  A new \\\"branch\\\" opened up as the story progressed and I anticipate at least one more will as I play through it.  However, I've noticed the more important upgrades aren't for base stats or even additional combat moves: its about having additional support. That sadly made more combat a bit boring despite how more effective it was.\\n\\nThen as you progress through the story, you get to a \\\"stage boss\\\" that has supposed \\\"weak points\\\".  My issue with this is that the game literally tells you the weak points are there, but the mechanics in the game don't allow you to focus your attacks towards them.  Resulting in you trying to position yourself for an attack that never pays off in the manner you mean it to.  \\n\\nThe story? .... Eh.  Makes sense in the world we're given.  \\n\\nAt the end, at the time of this review: If the game is under $20, it's worth a play.  Otherwise? No.  \\n\\nNope.\\n\\nNarp.\\n\\nNein.\\n\\nNil.\\n\\nZip.\\n\\nPlay a \\\"Tales of...

As I give the game a drive, I'll let you know what I think about it.\\nThere are points in the game that are really great, being able to synergize attacks with other characters that you borrow powers from or some of the abilities you eventually get to use are great. The small enemy roster and samey environment layouts make the combat repetitive and dull after a while. Sometimes the camera will mess you up, as the game has this habit of locking on to enemies that you are not trying to focus on, ending up getting you seriously hurt or koed.  I actually turned that off, but I still continued locking on to enemies which would mess up my combat loop.  This game is also guilty of the cut scenes prematurely ending buildup abilities that take time to refill.  The arenas are sometimes really small, you don't have room to maneuver when there's 6 enemies you have to dodge and avoid, which trust me, you'll get hit a lot. You are not able to cancel attacks, and if you go to hit one of the many bullet sponge enemies, you're locked into the attack and will get hit by enemy on the other side of arena (they have ranged attacks that can hit you from across the screen, without you ever being aware).  Sometimes when you think you've dodged an attack, the enemy you dodged will follow up with another attack, or you'll get slammed by an enemy you have not seen.  You or your partners will go down several times during an encounter, and forget trying to revive them-that spells the end for certain.  I question the motives of the developers sometimes.  I honestly wonder if they have it in for the gamer. \\nWhat is up with the super super long boss fights?

It's flashy and cool looking. Honestly it could be an anime. So good.\\n\\n[h1]The Story[/h1]\\nThe game is set in both the near future and an alternate reality where humanity has developed technology and formed a society based on the substances found in human brains. These substances also grant humans extrasensory superpowers. The Other Suppression Force (OSF) recruits members with supernatural abilities to protect humanity from the Others, mindless mutants which descend from the Extinction Belt. It's got a good beginning, middle and end i would say. But you might want to play both characters if you want to know everything.\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\\nScarlet Nexus is an action role-playing game played from a third-person perspective. Players can assume control of either Yuito Sumeragi or Kasane Randall, members of the Other Suppression Force (OSF) who are tasked to defend New Himuka from creatures known as the Others. While they are equipped with short-range weapons like a sword, both Yuito and Kasane possess the ability of psychokinesis, allowing them to hurl objects and debris at hostile enemies. The protagonist's powers can be upgraded through accessing the \\\"brain map\\\", which serves as the game's skill tree. As players progress, they encounter different party members who assist them in combat. Each companion has their own unique combat abilities, which can then be acquired by the protagonists through an ability named \\\"brain link\\\". It does get repetitive around a little over halfway with enemies spawns. Some levels had me scratching my head.\\n\\n[h1]Combat[/h1]\\nThe combat is cool and flashy even in its qte (quick time event). I played as Kasane for my first playthrough all the way. You can use different abilities through Brain Link to link an ability from a 1 or more companions to vary up your playstyle a bit. However, the duration varies on the ability and they operate under a cooldown system for each. Probably for balance as some i think would be too overpowered because you can be very strong and probably can break the game is some ways. However there seems to be some limitations with some abilities if you had a specific idea in mind with to combo with. There are 5 status effects that can triggered in combat with a negative effect specifically if you get affected.\\n\\n[h1]Soundtracks[/h1]\\nScarlet Nexus has fire soundtracks. Ask B.A.B.E.\\n\\n[h1]Performance[/h1]\\nThe game performed well for me until i would say maybe half way into the game where i started to get some random crashes. Sometime it was during a cutscene or after it. Sometimes when there's a lot of effects going off at once and the game just can't keep up. I even got one during the final boss fight with a mini window saying it crashed in the middle of the screen but i was still able to keep playing for some weird reason and i tried to not click the window because i knew it would close the game. But the game close on its own after a few mins so i had to redo it. About 25% hp left too lol... Other than that it runs fine even uncapped.\\n\\n[h1]Visual[/h1]\\nI mean look at it. The characters are well designed and the world's art style is cool. The cutscenes are ok but it seems like they couldn't decide if they wanted to go full animated cutscenes or this slideshow style they went with. We got both but it seems to me it's probably to reduce the amount of work they had to do which isn't bad. Sometimes i was wondering why didn't they just do a full cutscene. It's fine i guess. Let me know what you think about it.  \\n\\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\\nIf you like anime or play these types of game than you know what you're getting yourself into. It's a great game with a cool story with a great cast of characters.

The developers tried to make it look like an anime cartoon, but the results are very poor. Got the impression that detailization is low and you are looking at pixel graphics. Also there is quite a dissonance between world and character styling. While the environment, buildings and monsters (called \\u201cOthers\\u201d) are designed in 3D style with acceptable level of detailization, the humans are made in amine-style and appear \\u201cflat\\u201d and lacking of details. The main characters appear more or less fine, but random citizens - really bad.\\n\\nI assume many players shut down the game shortly after seeing the actual gameplay visual. But if you take enough patience and continue playing, you may still enjoy the game. After some time you will get used to the visual styling and it will appear fine enough for you.\\n\\nStill I don\\u2019t really get it: why the visuals have been implemented in this way? Don\\u2019t get me wrong - I do like the amine-styling games. But this is the worst implementation of it I can remember. There are many games with nice graphics like \\u201cTales of Berseria\\u201d, \\u201cCode Vein\\u201d and so on, which come from the same development studio. What was wrong with reusing their engine?\\n\\nThe main gameplay is quite enjoyable. Character uses melee combat combined with telekinesis power to defeat the enemies. We travel through the world as a team of characters with different supernatural powers. Hanabi throws fire at the enemies, Kagero can make himself invisible, Kuoka can make temporary clones of herself and so on. The most interesting part is the \\u201cSAS\\u201d system, which allows us to borrow teammate power for a short period. Different enemies and combat situations require different power usage to overcome, like you need to use teleportation or hypervelocity to catch nimble enemies. Powers also used to bypass certain world obstacles like gates and switches.\\n\\nThe game provides us with a selection of the main playable character. We can play for Yuito or Kasane. Both have the same power, but use different weapons. The main feature here is they have a different story. Overall the game events are the same for both characters, but you will see it through a different perspective. The dialogs, the teammate selection and missions will vary depending on the character you play for. Thus, it is quite likely you will replay the game at least once.\\n\\nThere are several types of enemies, each requiring special tactics and power combinations to be defeated. For each type there are several slight variations of creatures, which appear and behave a little differently.\\n\\nThe storyline is quite good and interesting, with several nice twists. I can not say it is something truly remarkable, but it is mostly enjoyable. It also raises tough social questions, like personal freedom, information control and social connections.\\n\\nHowever, the game itself is linear. We can not choose dialog options in conversations, can not make any kind of decisions, pick up a side quest or something. It is just like we watch the movie, which has the breaks for fighting the enemies.\\nNote: there are \\u201cquests\\u201d in the game, but I personally can not call them that way. These are just battle challenges, which require defeating a specific type of enemy in a specific way.\\n\\nAlso, we can revisit the locations we have traveled to before, but simply to battle the enemies respawned here.\\n\\nThe most disappointing feature is \\u201cteam bonds\\u201d. We travel as a squad (platoon to be more precise), consisting of different characters with different personalities. As a good leader our character has to build relationships with his team. It sounds good and logical, but it has been implemented quite poorly. First of all, we have no control over the dialogs, thus we do not actually \\u201cbuild\\u201d relationships with characters - we just witness Yuito/Kasane doing it. Secondly, all related stories and conversations are quite childish and naive. Although, it may be just me getting old\\u2026 But foremost, the bond episodes simply do not match the story events. Just now Kasane\\u2019s team attacked Yuito in order to kill him, but after that Yuito is having a friendly meeting with Kasane\\u2019s teammate at the cafe, like nothing happened. Another example: Yuito has been declared the \\u201cenemy of the state\\u201d during the main story event, but it does not prevent him from meeting the friend at the city central restaurant. I got a feeling that bond episodes were made by a separate development team, which had a hard time communicating with the one making the main story.\\n\\nThere are other small things, which spoils the impression. Our hideout is a small apartment, which has a single sofa, and does not even have a restroom. Still it somehow hosts 12 people inside of it.\\n\\nAlso saving points should be mentioned here. In order to save the game we should interact with some special men in yellow, which magically appear all over the world along with the supply shops. When we first meet such a character inside the city - it looks fine. But when they appear at the secret closed research facility, sealed super-computer core and so on - it looks stupid. It would be more logical, if some automated terminals served for the same purpose.\\n\\nThe total score for this game is 6/10. Overall, it is more positive than negative, but it is barely there.\\nIf you like action games and Anime, you can try this out, otherwise - pick something else.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.03223351536598609, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.04211374592274667, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"At first I was like oh cool anime hack n slash then.....I wanted to cry....then....ooh yeah baby I got a new sword slash slash slash....then that ending...pain.....regret........sad\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.023173547140677767, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"I like this game.

I thoroughly enjoyed this game from start to finish, and even liked it more than other similar titles that are more souls-like (i.e. Code Vein).  I've decided to write a thorough review because I was on the fence about buying this for a while, but am glad I did.  \\n\\nThe Story:\\nI thought the main plots of the game were both interesting and full of emotional twists and turns, and I found that every time I expected some big issue or character motivation to be glossed over, it was subsequently addressed in dialogue or through other means.  I also really hate plot contrivances in games like this, as these types of game plots start out solid but as the game progresses, there are many things that are added just for the sake of plot to progress.  While it isn't free of them entirely, there were no \\\"plot sins\\\" that were too hard to overlook for me, or tarnished the feel of the game.  There are a few instances where fights are added in very obviously for the sake of leveling, progressing, etc. but those are to be expected and it actually didn't detract from the story much at all, because the environments and combat kept it feeling fresh.  \\n\\nThe Combat:\\nThe combat in this game is so fun.  I loved the fights in this game so much.  The guard break system and kill animations thereafter are sick and feel great with the sound effects, without disrupting the flow of combat too much.  The rush combos keep combat constantly flowing if you so wish.  The SAS connections feature allows new powerful combos and as more and more characters are added to the party, the options increase exponentially.  Even though these types of games are very grindy, I hardly even noticed because figuring out new combos and trying new characters and powers that are added as you go was so intriguing.  The brain point system of upgrades allows you to upgrade specific areas of combat you choose or enjoy, and by the end of the game I was specced into most of them.  I could go on and on, and there is more that I haven't even mentioned.  Anyway, super fun.\\n\\nOther things:\\nI thought the dialogue \\\"box\\\" system was weird and maybe annoying at first, but as I progressed it kinda grew on me.  It also makes you appreciate the stuff that is fully animated, and they always animate the really important parts as well, so I found it endearing, as the pictures they show in the background reminded me of a visual novel style. \\n\\nThe soundtrack to this game was phenomenal.  Lots of future sounding stuff, mixed with a lot of funky beats and basslines.  The emotional parts had many beautiful and swelling songs behind them as well.  I don't have thoughts on any specific tracks yet, but I will definitely be listening to this OST at work and for leisure.\\n\\nI could see how the bond system might upset some people, as it makes you do side missions with the characters on your team to upgrade their in-combat abilities.  However, if you really dislike the idea of this, you can always just skip the scenes.  Since I am a sucker for music/storylines and character development, I loved it.  You can also give gifts to your teammates that appear in their specific \\\"corners\\\" of the hideout you use, which i thought was very cute and really tied into the whole \\\"teamwork makes the dream work\\\" theme of the game. \\n\\nConclusion:\\nAll in all, I found this game very fun, refreshing, and not bogged down with a lot of the typical issues you see in games of the same genre.  It still has it's issues, but they are overshadowed by how solid the entire experience was.  If I had to rate it, I would say it's a personal 8.0-8.5.  For reference, my first playthrough (Yuito) took me about 43 hours.  I didn't do a ton of the side quests besides the character ones though.  If you've read this far, thank you, and hopefully this helped you in your considering of purchasing this game.  <3\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.03179982541534558, \"joke\": 1, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Good stuff\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.021350161993229345, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"very good at story and effective skill so very nice\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.03263694478583078, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Great story.

Cause I know some like it that way. Scarlet Nexus is a pretty good game. Combat, although takes a little while to kick in, does with a bang! Truly fun once you get into the flow. Although everything is a button or two press away, it will most likely take a bit to get into the groove. Once you do though, this game will shine!\\n\\nThe world isn't large. Split into levels with a few hub like areas to walk around in. I'll be honest, kind of disappointed. Mainly because the hub areas you get are highly detailed. So are the levels you fight and progress in but I am speaking on the social aspect of the game when I say this. I wished they incorporated these hub areas more. Outside of finding items and side missions, not much else to do with them. However, the detail they add to them, makes me want to run around and enjoy it more. If there is a SN2, I hope they use it. They did good in my opinion. \\n\\nCharacters are sadly the normal every day JRPG trope. Main guy with a heart of gold, the girls swoon over him (at least seems like it), not sure of his true potential, befriends everyone. Main girl with an attitude. Everyone tries to break ice with her because they just want to be friends, but sadly she is too distant. You also got the quiet girl, big old tough guy, loud girl, nerdy boy and so on. Not to say I do not like the characters, I do honestly. But I truly wish they would mature their characters. This goody two shoe has gone on for decades now. Time to grow up. I truly say this because one character is ten. Well, not ten, he is actually \\\"decades old\\\"... I am not even joking. They at least explain why he looks like he is ready for Sunday school, but still. This goes for more of the cast too. Why can we not have a team of adults? I get marketing, but man, this is going too far in my opinion. \\n\\nAs far as the story, and not to go into too much detail, I find it interesting. That being said, sadly it can be predictable. Not sure why writers make the \\\"good guy\\\" look bad, or give way too much foreshadowing (please stop doing both) but none the less intriguing. Crazy creatures come out of nowhere and humans set up a fighting force to stop them. Why they are there, how they got there, drive your character to find answers. Which of course leads to more questions. \\n\\nSo in the end, I was honestly surprised. I played the demo twice, not popping each time. But something about Scarlet Nexus made me give it a shot. At 30 bucks, DLC included, why not? I had two hours. And here we are now, 40/50 hours in and I haven't beaten my first play through yet (very close though). So I would think you are probably getting a full 80/100 hours depending if play through both stories (as Yurito and Kasane). If you like anime, melee combos and an interesting story, give it a shot! I personally enjoy it.  \\n\\nTo be fair!

The combat is stiff until you get about half way through the game and doesn't really flow well until the last quarter of the story. There's apparently some postgame stuff to use all the things on, but i'm not super motivated to do it since the combat got a bit repetitive and particularly consistent fun after a bit of having roughly all the abilities due to the way some enemies work. The story is very predictable but adequate and never felt particularly painful since it does actually progress rather than spinning wheels on the same point like many mediocre plotlines do. The characters are standard anime archetype personalities done well enough with some fun gags. Of the two main character companions, the Yuito group seems to be more kiddos plus one old guy, while Kasane's group is somewhat more mature in attitude overall but still early twentiesish level of maturity at most. The plot reflects this relatively teenager-minded cast so don't expect serious time travel psychological drama out of it.\\n\\nNothing notably bad about the game's build quality other than levels are reused more than I feel was appropriate.

Let me start out by saying the way the game's dialogue is set up. It's made to act kind of like a visual novel. There are some cut scenes, but a majority of the events (whether side or main story) are done using that visual novel layout. I won't lie, it threw me off a bit at first and I wasn't really happy with it. It didn't take me too long to get over this though, so I wouldn't let it drive you away either. I will advise you to bear with the slow pace that happens for the first hour of the story. Once you get past that, everything will start to pick up.\\n\\nIs it really open world? This is the one I always want to cover, because it can be misleading and controversial at times. From my perspective, it is, but it's not the full exploration type. There is backtracking as well as free roam, but if you're hoping to explore a large world with seamless environments, you are not going to see that in this game. All the different areas you go to are disconnected and while there are items to find off of the main path, you won't come across much. Areas are open, but they're usually just for simply giving room for combat. That said, I hardly think this holds the game back by much. The environments are actually interesting even though you can't explore a large area around them.\\n\\nThe Combat: I'm going to be honest here, there is A LOT in terms of what you can do in this game. The actual combos you can do are simple to a certain extent, but not too limiting either. If you want a comparison, think of how Nier Automata plays with it's light and heavy attacks as well as mid air attacks. It also rewards you if you dodge at the right time by giving you special counter options. But if the basic attack commands and dodging mechanics doesn't leave you satisfied, don't worry, that's not even the biggest focus of the game's combat system. Adding to it, is the ability to throw objects at enemies using psychokinesis and yes it can be chained with basic combos. The real icing on the cake however goes to the special SAS system that lets you use the abilities of other party members. This can give your basic attacks specials effects, buff you so you can see invisible enemies etc. There's more that comes from this system, but I won't spoil all of it ;) . What's especially nice is that the game doesn't dump all of it on you at the start like others do. It all comes at a steady manageable pace, so you won't have to worry about getting a ton of new abilities thrown at you and end up having to frantically review tutorials during a fight. The combat itself is also well balanced. Even though it has hack and slash mechanics, it does challenge you to think a bit and stay focused. As for how hard the enemies are, it really does vary. On their own, they're nothing to sneeze at (much), but you always fight them in groups, which makes the experience far more enjoyable.\\n\\nThe Story: The way the game tells the story is interesting, because it splits the events between two characters. There are some events that will overlap, but for the most part both characters have their own unique story that happens simultaneously. The characters are very different in personality and the main focus in each story covers different topics. I'm not going to spoil anything, but if you like interesting plot lines, you'll love this.\\n\\nThe Characters: I won't lie, I can see the usual anime/manga type personalities in these characters, but I would not let that turn you away so early. It takes a while, but you'll slowly learn a lot more about these characters through special interactions. Through them, they'll start to seem more like real people and not just some stand ins. Development is done well when it comes to them. As for the voice acting, I don't really have a lot to say about it. The more serious scenes I think felt kind of forced at times (I was using English VA for the game so you know).\\n\\nAnything I didn't like? Only one thing and that's the gear system. They do give you stronger weapons for both the character you control and the ones the NPCs in your party use, but the game does not put any focus into this. It's just... there and that's all that can really be said about it.\\n\\nFinal Conclusion: This is definitely a game you should try out if you like fast paced hack and slash mechanics. Like I said before, the SAS system adds so much to the experience. It is kind of a shame that the game isn't a more explorable open world type, but not being one doesn't hurt it that much. The split story is interesting, the combat is immersive and I bet you'd come to like a few of the characters after learning more about them. 10/10, you should really give this one a try.\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.018998215372240442, \"joke\": 1, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Update After Clearing Game With Kasane\\n\\nSo i got into this game expecting an average ok game but honestly this game is excellent.\\nthe story is very interesting and original same for all the character you gonna meet in the game and there is quite a lot of them, the gameplay is extremely fun and easy to learn but hard to master.\\nthe cutscene presentation the voice acting the design of the world, equipment and character is very unique and beautiful, the gameplay is very fast paced and again extremely fun.\\n\\ni seriously didn't expect this game to be that good but the fact is that's a very good game in all aspect, the only side were it's a bit lacking would be the equipment for character where you don't have many option beside plug in and brain map which is basically your skills\\nbut that's not necessarily a bad thing nor does it make the game bad, if you like anime good story deep character and fast paced and very fun gameplay go ahead you won't regret it.\\n\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.40757975952313213, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"I'm really liking the character models from this company.

gotta grind to get some of the mats needed\\n- there is no actually quantifiable gauge for bond links so i was unable to tell how much more gifts i would need to gift the characters (it only tells us the level) or if i had reached the max for the current phase (is that even a thing?) \\n\\n+/- i spent around 30 hours for my first playthrough with kasane, without skipping any cutscenes. \\n+/- you can buy outfits and add wearable items/ cosmetics onto each character (i.e., visuals such as sunglasses, cat ears, mask) and it shows up in cutscenes as well. there aren't a great variety of visuals that are particularly outstanding but it's passable. if you want more, there are more outfits and weapons in the DLCs \\n+/- not much exploration to do as it's not an open-world game; the city isn't super big but it's sufficiently big enough for its purpose, and you will end up visiting the rest of the maps (some a couple of times) during the story anyway. \\n+/- side quests are something you can ignore and not do as it's non-consequential to the entire plot and there's no story or anything behind them. it felt more like challenges to me so i didn't really felt like pursuing them. i wish side quests had more meaning or at least we get to see how normal citizens live their lives in such an interesting world. felt like it was a wasted opportunity. \\n \\n[h1] Tips [/h1]\\n[list]\\n[*]just accept all side quests that you find along the way. you don't have to do them at all if you don't want to/if you don't feel like it. this is so that if you accidentally clear it while doing the main story, you can mark it as complete and collect the rewards from the menu. \\n[*]bond episodes/ stories with each character add on to all the character's individual development and growth, including the main character you play as. to get the most out of the story and character, try not to skip them as it also adds background info for some characters, eve the protagonists. \\n[*]your second playthrough with the other character should be on a new game+ on a cleared save file with the first character you chose - you can choose to retain levels and items, and it helps you unlock the achievements and challenges as well \\n[*]if you're on the fence about buying this game, play the story demo and/or get it on a sale \\n[/list]\\n\\n[h1] How's the Demo? [/h1]\\n[list]\\n[*]i played the story demo, which allows you to play up to phase 2. if you play the story demo, you can port your save file to the actual game; your steam hours don't port over though. \\n[*]the demo gives you a sense of how the gameplay will generally be like (there are more mechanics further down the phases). if you do not like the story demo, the game is likely not for you.\\n[/list]\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.39953151056566316, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"[b]>Story[/b]\\nOption of two playable characters with different perspectives, fairly dialogue heavy, with combat segments of varying length in-between.

Other enemies may be only vulnerable when you use a certain ability with a cooldown, so you are waiting sometimes repeatedly for that ability to be ready to use again (but most of these enemies weak to a certain ability are low HP at least). Kinda should be glass canons with short vulnerability phases, or tanks that you can attack always. I find myself turning the difficulty to Very Easy for those fights (so far one boss, and a recurring enemy) not because it is hard but because I don't want to spend 5 minutes on every standard battle or ages on that boss.\\n\\n- Perfect Dodging and countering is presented as a key component to the gameplay, but enemies are not designed for it. Attacks in this game by most enemies involve a wind-up such as raising an arm, then staying completely still for a while, then swinging/attacking/throwing the attack at a speed that is not human reactable. This means you need to learn every enemy attack pattern and there are no real cues for when to dodge, only that an attack is going to happen *instantly* at some point in the next ~1 to 2 seconds--personally not what I enjoy, but with the popularity of Dark Souls maybe others like this style.\\n\\n- Controls get pretty stuffed if you want to play keyboard + mouse and require some uncomfortable reaches. Best played with a keybound mouse if you want that control scheme. It plays fine with controllers though.\\n\\n- The segmented, dual protagonist story has had a few moments where they cross-over and make little sense, in ways that do not feel intentional. The story has confusion intentionally in many parts, but character changes off-screen from people you saw like once feel awkward. Enjoying the story still!\\n\\nThis is a great buy especially while it is on sale still.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.020057220860622046, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Good game\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.022822593306393912, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Negative\", \"review_text\": \"Pretty boring, long cut scenes and an empty world.\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.3455374736076228, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"[h1]Preface[/h1]\\nStart by doing Yuito's campaign, he's easier to get into, has an easier campaign and sets up a bunch of things that will be paid off in Kasane's campaign. You can start Kasane first but the game is rather blatant with setting Yuito's campaign as the one that you should play first as it gives the player questions that Kasane's campaign will later answer.\\n\\n[b]Game Length:[/b] Roughly 25-35 hours per campaign depending on whether you want to watch every single cutscene, bond episode and side quests.\\n\\n[h1]About DLC...[/h1]\\nThe DLC opens up way more ways to play the game, giving tons of new plugins (accessories that give passive effects) that actively change the gameplay. In fact they do it a bit too much... There's a lack of variety in terms of accessories that change playstyles in the game that it's hard to recommend playing without the DLC.\\n\\nThe bond episodes also give very strong passives but are really only very beneficial for post game content with the vision simulator, otherwise they're mostly just extra bonding episodes that give more backstory and wrap up character arcs. Some of them really should've just been a free update instead of a DLC but gotta work with what we got I suppose.\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay and Difficulty[/h1]\\nGames rather easy, not the hardest thing in the world. As usual with JRPGs hard mode is a rollercoaster, starting pretty hard ending rather meh. Gameplay is simple but fun, if you really get into it you can do a lot of unique combos and get your own playstyle that's fun. Certain equipment being locked entirely to DLC sucks and limits the playstyles but for the most part the base game has enough variety to keep you going, specially with Kasane and Yuito having mostly different skillsets.\\n\\nYuito's much easier to play and has way better weapon attacks while Kasane focuses way more on using her pyschokinesis follow ups and better flow.  Regardless of who you play first the combat is definitely a great highlight.The only cripes I have with the gameplay is just debuffs, the debuffs are massive annoyances to the player and only the player and add barely anything to the game.\\n\\n[b]Is the game grindy?[/b]\\nGrinding is entirely optional but can be very annoying when you want specific things because a lot of drops (mainly Other analysis data) are not buyable which can be very frustrating. \\n\\n[h1]Side Content[/h1]\\nSide quests sometimes give you things that you can't get yet as rewards but are generally rather useless to do. Earlier ones are alright but the later ones can get annoying as they're basically side challenges. Finding them is also annoying as they only show up on the minimap (not the enlarged area map). The only ones of note are the ones in post game that unlock the final weapons for each character.\\n\\n[h1]The Problem...[/h1]\\nKasane and Yuito's story only really differ till about phase 9/10. Everything after phase 9 could've and should've been fused as both sides [spoiler]merge together[/spoiler] and aside from a tiny amount of extra scenes in phase 10 and 11 and different vantage point in phase 12, the last 3 phases (chapters) of the game are a schlog as you gotta go through the same main story with very minor changes.\\n\\nThe rest of the game is different enough to justify the separate campaigns but personally think there could be much better ways to tell both stories without making you have to play separate campaigns to the very end, especially when the final 3 chapters are extremely similar to each other.\\n\\nKasane's characterization is also out of whack around for a few chapters which makes her annoying in her campaign but for the most part it gets better.\\n\\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\\nGood game, recommend waiting for a sale though so you can get the season pass so you can experience the game in it's best form. If you got money to burn buying it off sale is fine as well as the game is decently long. Can get kinda tiresome by the end of finishing the 2nd MC campaign but definitely worth checking out.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.3721299140155608, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"A very enjoyable game for me. The combat isn't to complicated and is very enjoyable. You are put in a team of 4 including yourself and you can \\\"borrow\\\" the powers of your team, which allows very fun combinations when in combat. The story isn't jaw dropping but is still nice. The story is split into two parts between the two main playable characters. What I like is how the two characters are different in some ways in terms of the story. All levels are the same in the game, but the objectives for the two are very much different. Then eventually the two plots meet and share an ending. The characters you encounter may be kind of generic, but they fulfill their purpose quite nicely and you may find yourself attached to some of them. The game also includes a bond level system in which you can level up the bond you have with someone from your team. Not only does it include a rise in effectiveness, but includes little side stories so you can learn more about your teammates and their personalities.\\n\\nI had a few gripes. The story while good is kind of poorly paced in my opinion. At times I was wondering if I missed something important because of it.  As mentioned prior, you can borrow the powers of your teammates. Though there were some powers that were shown off you can't use. Not really a game problem, but a selfish complaint XD. The equipment system was honestly a nuisance. Even though you can buy better weapons for you and your team, it felt unnecessary.

I went to it practically totally blind, because I was fascinated by stylization and fights from the trailer. And I was extremely satisfied in that regard. Unfortunately, the rest of the game is not as good in places as I would expect.\\n\\nTwo in one\\nRight at the beginning, an important choice awaits you as to which of the two protagonists you will play. But how important is it really? Surprisingly, since each of the characters has their own storyline, so they visit different locations, have different people on the team, and solve different problems with other enemies. From time to time, their lines intersect and in the last third they are forced to cooperate, so it's not a completely different game, unlike the second act of The Sorcerer 2, which was completely different depending on who you were affiliated with. Each of the heroes is also played differently - Yuito is more likely to be slashed, while Kasane likes to keep a slight distance from enemies. However, if you immerse yourself fully in the story, you will still want to go through both stories, because in one pass certain questions will still remain unanswered and the events you would otherwise have to face yourself will be communicated to you in just a few sentences. This is made easier by New Game Plus, so you don't have to worry about having to start from scratch again on the second pass. Not that it bothers me, because the game is very easy. But about that later\\u2026\\n\\nJapanese beauties\\n\\nWhere Scarlet Nexus gains valuable points are the characters. During the game you will meet almost two dozen, which are interesting and almost half of them will be in your party. You can only take two into the fight, but the abilities can be used indefinitely by everyone. Between parts of the story, there are so-called standby phases, when you are in your hiding place, you can have conversations with the characters, help them with tasks, give them gifts and thus strengthen the bond between you, which brings very useful bonuses to the fights. The higher the bond between you, the more often they will save your neck, they will offer to help you make a stronger attack, or the skills you use are stronger, longer lasting, etc. In addition, it is a pleasure to watch the interaction with them, which is often funny and it is such a lightening of the dense atmosphere from the basic story. I was pleased that most of the time they don't just stand dumb in the character's hiding place, but do something, so you witness often smiling animations. Some people might mind the stylization of the cutscenes, which are overwhelmingly told through comic book boxes, but it didn't bother me and it sat here.\\n\\nDelightfully stylized duels\\n\\nFights are then a delicacy. Their styling is famous and even though they are very simple from the beginning and with even increasing time and increasing skills they are even lighter, I must say that they look at them beautifully and it is nice to play. It's terribly satisfying gameplay. Enemies have lives and a shield, if you take the latter to zero before health, you can execute them in a great short animation at the touch of a button. Otherwise, you beat the enemy with a weapon that can be upgraded to a new level thanks to crafting. Among other things, there are also a few accessories, whether functional or visual. But chopping into enemies is just a necessity. Each of the characters in the party offers, in addition to a total of intelligence in a duel, where you can set exactly what to do, especially their ability. And these are also available for characters that you don't have on a mission, so instead of two abilities, up to nine will be available to you. And something can be done about it. In addition, over time, you can unlock the ability in the ability tree so that you can activate up to 4 different abilities at once, leading to brutal results. Cutting at enemies with a sword can be fun, but once you activate fire damage (so huge flames whip from your cuts), you'll add the ability to teleport short distances (so dodging enemy attacks is even easier), plus the ability to see the invisible enemies (in some instances an absolute necessity) and the icing on the cake is the short-term immortality\\u2026no\\u2026 It's just a delicacy. The main characters themselves are not far behind, they can lift objects and throw them at the enemy, and even in this respect the game surprises when you need to jump on the roof of the bus and ride with it on the highway littered with enemies and cross them\\u2026 And thanks to With up to nine abilities that are different and each suits not only a different situation but also a different enemy, the whole process of elimination is fun. The combat system is far too good, which unfortunately encounters fewer types of enemies. Their design is incredible, in a good way, but the numbers are larger and the variety smaller. In addition, new species are usually just slightly modified old versions. At least it's visually great to watch them and watch the killing animations.\\nBut that's not all. There is a special Brain Drive, during which you get bonuses to kill enemies and then especially Brain Field. Once the second indicator is full, you can activate it at any time. You will then move in style to a breathtaking location for a few seconds, where the rules are slightly different than in the basic game. The main character goes crazy, giggles like crazy while literally crushing the enemy's head. Here you have a limited time when you have to get out quickly, otherwise you will die because it will hurt your brain. But thanks to the ability tree, you can be a god, so you don't have to take any damage in Brain Field, you can double your time here and increase your attack in such a way that not only your character but also you will just laugh.\\nThe visuals and the music are great, the whole styling suited me immensely. The locations are ok, some breathtaking, others so empty and nothing much. They are linear, but from time to time you can get somewhere for a bonus item. It is possible to return to them and farm the enemies. There are also side missions, which are challenges and I didn't enjoy them much. They are that x you have to kill the enemy in a way. I also found it strange that sometimes the text didn't match what the character was saying. The game saves itself, but it can also be saved in certain places. The last downside is the constant display of tips that can't be turned off, as well as after time annoying offers and tips from NPCs that infuse you with familiar info.\\n\\nCome (again) save the world\\n\\nScarlet Nexus is a demonstration Japanese game. The fights, together with the styling, are the absolute top. The characters are memorable and you will care about them. You will be happy to miss a few lapses in the story, because the gameplay is so incredibly addictive. It's just a great game and I recommend it to all fans of hack and slash style games.\\n\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.030944499364204476, \"joke\": 1, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"This reminds me of persona 4.

So whenever you open it up you spend a good minute lining things up to see which way you're facing and where you need to go\\n- Enemies with one specific way to defeat them. WHY. I'm all for enemies with specific mechanic and tricks to defeat them easier, but Scarlet Nexus' monsters, the ones with specific mechanics and gimmicks, are near impossible to defeat without the right companion NPC in your team. So if you run into them without those NPC with you? Good luck.\\n- You're constantly faced with groups of monsters that you have to fight against, you will be outnumbered a lot, which is fine. But then you realize even the ones outside of your camera view can whack your shit up, which lead to your combo constantly interrupted by attacks that you can't see coming, The camera view is not very big btw, and this just make for a frustrating combat experience.\\n- The lock on feature doesn't move your camera until the locked-on monster moves out of view. I have countless time unable to find the monster that i'm locked onto, only to see it hovering the edge of my screen.\\nedit: and i think the dodge move in this game doesn't have i-frame either.

Gameplay wise it's very fast-paced, comparable to Platinum games and Devil May Cry. It's flashy, it's quick, and on higher difficulty will test your reflexes. It's not really open world: You can travel to large instances, be it dungeons or cities/hubs, using the world map. \\n\\nThe story is set in a heavily sci-fi world, the cities colored with augmented reality advertisements and people messaging each other with just their brains. A setting where many people are born with psychic powers like pyrokinesis, teleportation, and invisibility. A world where nothing is as it seems, complex plots and conspiracies abound the corners of the underground. Reminds me a bit of Blade Runner. And you get to experience it from two different perspectives, in ENG or JP depending on your preferences. \\n\\nThe journey is split between two characters, Yuito and Kisane. You can select who to start with, the other becoming another campaign option to play with on your next playthrough. Each campaign is around 20 hours worth of story, and while each of the two has the same superpower they have a different play style of applying it. Yuito uses a sword and is a melee rush-type, while Kisane is a ranged zoner with throwing knives. Selecting a character will not only lock you to that character's PoV, but also certain party members, though you will interact with the other team throughout the story and get to try to them out.\\n\\nThe gameplay's mostly set into \\\"chapters\\\", and you're allowed to rest between chapters in your hub area and interact with your party members, give them gifts, have \\\"bond episodes\\\" (think Persona's social links) with them to increase your relationship and in turn, make both you and them stronger. The characters can be a bit tropey at times, but they're not badly written, especially if you go through the bond episodes to flesh them out beyond the tropes. You can also visit other cities and talk to NPCs for world building and accepting side quests. \\n\\nOnce a chapter start, it usually moves the story forward and takes you to a new area where combat is expected. The combat is VERY fun. Your character can attack either with their weapon or their superpower, telekinesis, in addition to the ability to \\\"link\\\" with 4 other party members and temporary gain their superpower as well. Your rotation often involves mixing your weapon attacks combos with your super powers, and using other people's superpowers, with other people's superpowers having 3 different ways of being used, allow for a large variety of combo and juggling potential. Once the combat \\\"clicks\\\", you'll be able to pull off some pretty cool combos.\\n\\nEnemies are spread throughout the areas and you can engage them stealthily for extra damage (e.g. through teleportation / invisibility). There is no down time between battling and exploring, and you're able to escape or heal right away with the click of a button. In addition to difficulty settings ranging from very easy to very hard, should you happen to fall in combat there is a chance for your teammates to revive you, and you're able to revive them manually without items as well (though it takes time). The game can be as forgiving and as punishing as you want it to be, allowing both action rpg vets and newcomers to tailor their experiences. Personally I went with Very Hard and it was a pain but also really fun and rewarding.\\n\\nOverall if any of this sounds good to you, I highly recommend getting this game.

The combat is intricate and fast-paced (the movement is in general), so I rarely if ever found myself getting bored of it.

I also appreciate the tertiary information you can access in the menu about the characters and \\\"Others\\\"; having things like a bestiary or compendium adds much to worldbuilding. The only issue I have with this is the translation. I don't mind the rare and expected grammatical error, but occasionally you'll come across stupid and jarring meme lingo like \\\"simp\\\" and \\\"based\\\" in some of the optional scenes that is obviously inaccurate and detrimental to immersion. I think Bandai Namco should be a bit more scrutinising when hiring for localisation.\\n\\nYou can customise your appearance in this to an extent I've rarely seen in other games, so it's useful if you want to look cooler or something. I done Yuito's route first and then followed with Kasane's route, as both are distinct enough in story and mechanics to justify a second playthrough. That said, if you're only doing one route, then I highly recommend that you do Yuito's route.

It holds your hands allot in the beginning as to how to use skills and its features however that is a good thing with how fast pace this game is. Let break it down into its qualities: \\n\\ncombat: Scarlet Nexus is a fast paced and fun to play game. It may take some getting used to for players who are used to menus to help them sit down and plan what they are going to do, however it is a joy for those who like streaming violence. Many of its combat features are intuitive, with the tutorial popping up to guide your hands were you may need some more technical features. There is no walking around the map and a special combat scene happening all combat happens in map and if you are competent can be avoided. You are rewarded for understanding how to use the combat system well and even the most difficult fights are made bearable with a good grasp of how to fight, the opposite is equally true. It's really cool to figure out a others weakness and exploit it and crush them, don't worry the announcer will tell you when you get status effects or are low on health for those of us with tunnel vision. Last the learning of skills gives you time to grow into how to use them after acquiring them. So over all I would give combat with all it's complexity a 9.5 out of 10, with the .5 missing for being in too small a space with too big and enemy and the camera goes brr, still could be my fault though.\\n\\nMusic and visuals: The game is beautiful a little gray in some places however that may be due to the depressing atmosphere the characters are placed in at times. Yes I am playing on a 21:9 ratio monitor and it is working well so that's another star for this game, away from that there aren't too many option to increase the character model or texture or rap it in sexy mode, which you get cause this game smells of console. Yes it is in anime style, I like anime so that's a plus to me, no two characters look alike and they all have their own unique personalities. The first city in the game while looking homey is 100% dystopian with cameras every inch and corner. Away from that each environment seem unique onto itself, well put together with lots of stuff to throw around. The music is really good and goes very well with the environment you are in, personally enjoy the jazz scores. Visual to me get a 8 out of 10 and similar for music, I mean its a good looking game but it seems obvious it started out on console.  \\n\\nLast is the User Interface: In combat the UI clean and simple not too much on the screen, which is a good thing, scroll wheel to select item press scroll wheel to use item, no pausing fun. When you press escape or f5 to get into menu its not hard but there is allot here, however Scarlet Nexus goes out of their way to slowly open it up to you and explain what each one does, so you won't have full access to it at the start of the game but over time you will so hopefully you won't be overwhelmed. just something I find useful it's really easy to submit a quest in game just go to the completed quest and click enter, which makes it rather impersonal but no more running around wondering who gave you which quest and where they currently are based on time of day. so for UI I honestly like it I'm giving them a 9 out of 10.\\n\\nSo over all I give  Scarlet Nexus (9.5+8+8+9)/4= 8.6 out of 10 its a fun game you won't get bored of if you love anime and fighting and adventure.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.02057178399285649, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Good Gooda Goods\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.03292342755687248, \"joke\": 1, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"<3\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.029010514262213034, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Great story fun fighting style\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.014042105322660878, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Fun hack and slash! 1000000/100\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.04639260269427435, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"good game. yes.\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.03306996110539771, \"joke\": 1, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Yes, this game has been a lot of fun!\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.036574698710022044, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"great weeb game 10/10\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.03773577167432325, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"cool combat ong fr ong fs fr fr fr fr oong\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.026463678762459253, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"yuito best waifu\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.07557827712723722, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Extremely mixed on this (especially after code vein being one of my favourite games and being released just before it)\\n\\nCombat is really fun and interesting but the story gets a handful of actually animated cutscenes, a MAJORITY of them are just visual novel style text boxes which heavily clashes with everything else, \\n\\nAnd don't know if it's because of the dlcs i have or not but they give you items that make you invincible, doubles the xp you gain and so on so, played on hardest difficulty without those items and was still pretty easy\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.01475977119285109, \"joke\": 1, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Fun game, becomes very gimmicky later on when enemies get stronger and you need to have the \\\"right\\\" powers to deal with their gimmick, which can become really annoying.

I went to it practically totally blind, because I was fascinated by stylization and fights from the trailer. And I was extremely satisfied in that regard. Unfortunately, the rest of the game is not as good in places as I would expect.\\n\\n[h1]Two in one [/h1]\\nRight at the beginning, an important choice awaits you as to which of the two protagonists you will play. But how important is it really? Surprisingly, since each of the characters has their own storyline, so they visit different locations, have different people on the team, and solve different problems with other enemies. From time to time, their lines intersect and in the last third they are forced to cooperate, so it's not a completely different game, unlike the second act of The Sorcerer 2, which was completely different depending on who you were affiliated with. Each of the heroes is also played differently - Yuito is more likely to be slashed, while Kasane likes to keep a slight distance from enemies. However, if you immerse yourself fully in the story, you will still want to go through both stories, because in one pass certain questions will still remain unanswered and the events you would otherwise have to face yourself will be communicated to you in just a few sentences. This is made easier by New Game Plus, so you don't have to worry about having to start from scratch again on the second pass. Not that it bothers me, because the game is very easy. But about that later\\u2026\\n\\n[h1]Japanese beauties[/h1]\\n\\nWhere Scarlet Nexus gains valuable points are the characters. During the game you will meet almost two dozen, which are interesting and almost half of them will be in your party. You can only take two into the fight, but the abilities can be used indefinitely by everyone. Between parts of the story, there are so-called standby phases, when you are in your hiding place, you can have conversations with the characters, help them with tasks, give them gifts and thus strengthen the bond between you, which brings very useful bonuses to the fights. The higher the bond between you, the more often they will save your neck, they will offer to help you make a stronger attack, or the skills you use are stronger, longer lasting, etc. In addition, it is a pleasure to watch the interaction with them, which is often funny and it is such a lightening of the dense atmosphere from the basic story. I was pleased that most of the time they don't just stand dumb in the character's hiding place, but do something, so you witness often smiling animations. Some people might mind the stylization of the cutscenes, which are overwhelmingly told through comic book boxes, but it didn't bother me and it sat here.\\n\\n[h1]Delightfully stylized duels [/h1]\\n\\nFights are then a delicacy. Their styling is famous and even though they are very simple from the beginning and with even increasing time and increasing skills they are even lighter, I must say that they look at them beautifully and it is nice to play. It's terribly satisfying gameplay. Enemies have lives and a shield, if you take the latter to zero before health, you can execute them in a great short animation at the touch of a button. Otherwise, you beat the enemy with a weapon that can be upgraded to a new level thanks to crafting. Among other things, there are also a few accessories, whether functional or visual. But chopping into enemies is just a necessity. Each of the characters in the party offers, in addition to a total of intelligence in a duel, where you can set exactly what to do, especially their ability. And these are also available for characters that you don't have on a mission, so instead of two abilities, up to nine will be available to you. And something can be done about it. In addition, over time, you can unlock the ability in the ability tree so that you can activate up to 4 different abilities at once, leading to brutal results. Cutting at enemies with a sword can be fun, but once you activate fire damage (so huge flames whip from your cuts), you'll add the ability to teleport short distances (so dodging enemy attacks is even easier), plus the ability to see the invisible enemies (in some instances an absolute necessity) and the icing on the cake is the short-term immortality\\u2026no\\u2026 It's just a delicacy. The main characters themselves are not far behind, they can lift objects and throw them at the enemy, and even in this respect the game surprises when you need to jump on the roof of the bus and ride with it on the highway littered with enemies and cross them\\u2026 And thanks to With up to nine abilities that are different and each suits not only a different situation but also a different enemy, the whole process of elimination is fun. The combat system is far too good, which unfortunately encounters fewer types of enemies. Their design is incredible, in a good way, but the numbers are larger and the variety smaller. In addition, new species are usually just slightly modified old versions. At least it's visually great to watch them and watch the killing animations.\\nBut that's not all. There is a special Brain Drive, during which you get bonuses to kill enemies and then especially Brain Field. Once the second indicator is full, you can activate it at any time. You will then move in style to a breathtaking location for a few seconds, where the rules are slightly different than in the basic game. The main character goes crazy, giggles like crazy while literally crushing the enemy's head. Here you have a limited time when you have to get out quickly, otherwise you will die because it will hurt your brain. But thanks to the ability tree, you can be a god, so you don't have to take any damage in Brain Field, you can double your time here and increase your attack in such a way that not only your character but also you will just laugh.\\nThe visuals and the music are great, the whole styling suited me immensely. The locations are ok, some breathtaking, others so empty and nothing much. They are linear, but from time to time you can get somewhere for a bonus item. It is possible to return to them and farm the enemies. There are also side missions, which are challenges and I didn't enjoy them much. They are that x you have to kill the enemy in a way. I also found it strange that sometimes the text didn't match what the character was saying. The game saves itself, but it can also be saved in certain places. The last downside is the constant display of tips that can't be turned off, as well as after time annoying offers and tips from NPCs that infuse you with familiar info.\\n\\n[h1] Come (again) save the world [/h1]\\n\\nScarlet Nexus is a demonstration Japanese game. The fights, together with the styling, are the absolute top. The characters are memorable and you will care about them. You will be happy to miss a few lapses in the story, because the gameplay is so incredibly addictive. It's just a great game and I recommend it to all fans of hack and slash style games.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.06092787368771348, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Fun\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.03983448525547137, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"i like alot\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.053071809148600456, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"This game is amazing!

This is unfortunately marred by the game's incredibly dull and barebones side quest and equipment system, which have no reason to exists in its current state. There's also a noticeable lack in enemy variety, so combat can get a little tedious later on, especially since there's a lack in gameplay variation.\\n\\nBut the worst offenders that tainted my entire experience is the game's absolutely horrendous story and it's piss poor execution and pacing. Calling the writing tone-deaf is an absolute understatement, and completely ruins any level of fun I might have. Plotlines are constantly introduced and casted aside at a drop of a hat, without any regard for tone and timing.\\n\\nCharacters that are painfully generic yet tolerable end up being detestable and just obnoxious because of the way the narrative is handled, and I end up having nothing but disdain even for my player character.\\n\\nI started this game intending to finish both playthroughs for the 2 protagonists - Yuito and Kasane, but now I couldn't even bring myself to finish my first playthrough. That's how much I hate the writing of this game.\\n\\nMaybe there's still something for people who can enjoy a game for just it's gameplay without caring about the story and whatnot, but if a dog leave a steaming pile of shit on my rice bowl, I would throw the whole fucking bowl away.\\n\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.021531726847536535, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Negative\", \"review_text\": \"Clunky fighting system which forces you to micromanage your team and rely on healing items\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.13719579868038972, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Negative\", \"review_text\": \"This game is a mess really.\\nThe first part of the game is kinda fun in it's own way. You start exploring game mechanics, find combos that deal the most dmg, look at characters and their dynamics and that looks kinda nice, the only problem with the first part is character introductions. There is just too many of them and the game presents them as if you NEED TO REMEMBER EACH ONE OF THEM. \\nBut as I kept playing I started to feel bored. Characters are cardboard cutouts of their respective anime tropes, combat is repetetive to the point that I've just started to avoid it (this game is in the slasher category, how could they screw combat that bad?), characters became just tropes and nothing more (maybe except for Kagero his backstory is ok), and the plot in the middle just didn't make sense (I truly was confused at some point because of how many [i]MYSTERIES[/i] there were). \\nAnd the last part of the game is just the worst. The only fun I had was in the hangout sections, trying to romance a few characters.\\nEnvironments reminded me of Nier:Automata, and I kinda dig it. Also the mountain part is nice. Other than those, environments are ok. And graphics are actually nice.\\nThe SAS system is actually nice too. It allows for variety of movements and some form of fluidity in combat. Unfortunately this fluidity goes out the window when enemies start requiring ONE SPECIFIC SAS ENHANCEMENT.\\n[h1] NOW FOR THE SPOILER PART [/h1]\\n[spoiler] From the very first time I saw Kasane, who looked exactly like this girl who saved Yuito, I knew there would be this shitty time travel story. Honestly, there are better games which do time travel much better. The story itself is convoluted and messy. There are too many moving parts in the beginning and the game tries [b]SO HARD[/b] to make sure the player doesn't understand [b]why[/b] things are happening, that you just stop asking why and go into braindead mode. \\nMy next issue is with Yuito (I haven't played Kasane's story yet, hope those problems don't apply to her). Yuito is dumb and his motivations are so dull that I just couldn't. Really, I have played most of the game thinking that Yuito is braindead (turned out he partly was). And if there are no motivation for the MC, I really don't feel motivation either. This is a problem with most of anime male MCs, but this doesn't mean it's acceptable. \\nThe villains are dull. Probably because the story tries very hard to be deep (lorewise). I didn't want to figth any of them except for Nagi. His fights were kinda fun. But Nagi's story is boring too. Writing team could have just put the sign \\\"I will die :)\\\" on his forehead and this would change nothing in terms of player expectations. \\nMusic is dull. Can't even vibe to this shit.\\nEnemy design is weirdly all over the place (as in sometimes that shit slaps, and sometimes its dull). You can clearly see animals in them, and since there are no animals on the street, it's easy to understand that animals turned into Others. Though, Naomi's Other desing is lit. Loved that boss fight.\\nLevel desing (not environment) is just awful in the end. THIS GAME IS NOT DESIGNED FOR PLAYER TO RUN A [strike]FUCKING[/strike] MAROTHON. And yet there I was, running through corridors with unskippable rooms of enemies. THE WORST ENEMIES. THE [b]ONE TRICK[/b] ENEMIES. Truly the hight of level design.\\n[/spoiler]\\nIn conclusion, this game [b]IS NOT A SLASHER[/b]. It is a rpg at best. With bland characters, bland fighting systems and bland story. \\nNo offence to developers. There are a lot of people who enjoyed and will enjoy this game, but I'm not one of them.\\n3/10.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.0318575388392372, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Negative\", \"review_text\": \"good concept. game play too repetitive to keep me interested in the story.\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.040281468598449374, \"joke\": 1, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Despite the fact of the new age gaming with \\\"wanna be games \\\" and unfinished products, Scarlet Nexus shines very bright over these and I recommend this game to be played.\\nMy note to this games is 9/10.\\nCons:\\n-maybe to childish\\n-power of friendship saves the day ( depends on you )\\n-anime ( depends on you ) \\n-boring introduction ( you need to reach Phase 4 to have the \\\"basics\\\" )\\nPoz:\\n-Cool story ( depends on you )\\n-fun and interactive game play\\n-simple mechanics \\n-not too grindy\\n- possibility to be OP ( depends on you )\\n- 30 hours + of game play.\\n\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.022303817024899926, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Negative\", \"review_text\": \"god jrpgs are so fkn bad. run through the same location 7000 times fight the same enemey 7 million times use the same 3 moves 7 billion times. god its so lame\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.05403426471255986, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Negative\", \"review_text\": \"Dear God this game is boring.\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.017559051356571858, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"weird game\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.019019250830399036, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Very fun game, very weird story.

This game is truly stunning artistically. The art style is crisp, the designing work is diverse between the human characters and monsters, with the monsters having extremely cool, whimsical designs that make them feel almost dreamlike. There's lots of use of consistent symbols and motifs that create good ties from a plot perspective as well. The cinematics, both in cutscenes and in battle are stellar. 9/10 on this front.\\n\\n -Audio. While the music wasn't super my cup of tea, it did serve really well to carry the mood in the game. Voice acting (I played English) was pretty good, too. 6/10.\\n\\n -Crafting system. A decent amount of things you want in the game like cosmetics and gifts to give to party members are going to require crafting with parts obtained from monsters. While simple, it encourages a bit of grinding and keeps you from just buying your way through everything. 6/10.\\n\\nNegatives:\\n -Story. This one actually caught me off guard. I went in not really expecting a good story, but this one actually builds up and becomes really interesting, before falling extremely flat. It's hard to say specifics without spoiling, but the story was making itself out to have a lot of intrigue before ultimately falling back on some empty history and \\\"friendship is magic\\\" stuff. There was multiple themes brought up but never explored in a significant way that could have really made the story impactful. To it's credit, they didn't do the \\\"friendship is magic\\\" in a poorly written and \\\"this happens because plot\\\" sort of way, it was actually done using something the story had already well established. 4/10.\\n\\n -Combat. It uh...it's just messy. It encourages weaving of psychokinetic and weapon attacks, kinda making unlocking weapon combos feel pretty obsolete. There's 9 abilities but only 8 slots to use them, meaning you have to go into the menu in mid-battle to change it if you wanna use your 9th ability. The main interesting thing the combat has going for it is the enemies each having specific weaknesses to specific abilities, requiring you to utilize your full skillset across your encounters. 5/10 serviceable but kinda poorly designed imo.\\n\\n -Skill Tree. Frankly, it feels kinda underwhelming. Most of the skill tree is passive buffs that don't feel super impactful in practice. There's a few that grant you noticeable new abilities, which are definitely cool, but they're far and few. 3/10.\\n\\n-New Game Plus. This is mostly just a design flaw and warning, but make sure you don't save over the file the game gives you right after beating the final boss. You may think you can load that file, play a bit, and save normally while keeping the \\\"completed\\\" tag functional, but it will only let you use a -freshly- beaten file to begin your new game plus, so make sure to keep that as a separate file.\\n\\n Overall, I wouldn't call this game absolutely terrible, but I don't think it's worth picking up. I'm usually pretty determined to go full completionist and get all the trophies and challenges but this game is overall so underwhelming I'm not bothering going into new game plus.

It's funny because you start to miss those NPCs come mid-game because there simply are NO NPCs to be found! How am I supposed to believe Suoh is a bustling city when it's dead for half the game? And all these Deserted zones outside the city? I can't connect to the environment if there's nothing but the same dummy enemies in them. \\n\\nHowever, I will say that the combat has a certain flow to it that is really gratifying. The flow of weaving in and out to use gravikinesis and dash in to melee enemies is really satisfying. SAS system on top of all of that is very empowering to the player.\\n\\nHowever, the combat just isn't enough to save this from being another run of the mill \\\"tales of\\\" type game. The story gets exciting 12 hours in but at that point most people would have probably moved on. The delivery of said story leaves much to be desired... why toggle between comic-style static panels and fully rendered cutscenes? If this was done for aesthetics I'll say it failed in that regard. Should have stuck to fully rendered cutscenes OR kept the panels and keep them shorter in length.\\n\\nIn summary, Scarlet Nexus is a run-of-the-mill Anime beat em up with an interesting story and good gameplay, but horrible world-building and game flow.\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.053825042293238215, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"E\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.0709277402994808, \"joke\": 1, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Good Game\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.3721461588025875, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Not much of an ANIME game person but this one is really well done.

Overall, I like this game, although, I enjoyed the narrative here a bit less than expected and the combat experience, on the contrary, much more. \\n\\nCombat is pretty much challenging and satisfactory. It's dynamic and tactical in nature with a ton of options which you're strongly encouraged to use in order to effectively defeat enemies. Numerous weapon and psionic attacks, combos, several SAS powers, allies' various helping moves, brain drives and fields, statuses applications to combine them with SAS, interactive environment, multitude of types of enemies, each with its own protections, weaknesses and a tactics to be used against. Boss fights are even more interesting and tactics-dependable.\\nI played on Normal and can say that it's impossible to just button-mash the battles. Almost any blow taken is crippling with the character is knocked out and having to drag theirselves back into the fight, remaining vulnerable all the while. You need to attack thoughtfully, depending on the type of enemy before you, consider its moves, time your strikes and dashes properly, activate appropriate SAS, use environment objects, break defenses and hit critical spots. Well, basically you've to use every tool at your arsenal to prevail and in the end you'll be satisfied with the experience as a reward in itself.\\n\\nOthers aspects (briefly, since the text limitation):\\nStory: OK with some cringy events and accelerated character and overall plot evolution.\\n\\nVisuals and art style: slightly below my expectations, but the style is there and it's not bad. Scenes are quite beautiful at times.\\n\\nLocations: not many types, a few distinct levels, more or less straight-forward, basically a string of arena-like rooms along a corridor.\\n\\nVoice acting: one of the best I've listened to in games (played Eng version). My respects to VAs of Kasane, Arashi, Kyoka and every other character.\\n\\nControls: compared to some other JRPGs, PC-controls in SN are made almost perfectly.

Empty. Like as if you're the only one who exists in this dull dystopian mega-city, there are barely NPCs & they really don't matter at all to the story, unless they're needed for immediate plot reasons. Scarlet Nexus is not a JRPG, The Official Japanese website calls it a \\\"Action RPG\\\" & so does Steam. [b]This game also deserves a Visual/Kinetic Novel tag because 80-90% of the cutscenes are still images that aren't engaging & really takes away from the experience on top of being low effort[/b]; Tales of Arise did this better bc cut scenes were all animated. Your group disbands and splits into two sides & what's confusing is the way they casually text/meet with the MC(Yuito) as wanted criminals & they want to kill him, but they casually drink and bond instead like nothings changed??!???\\n\\nMany plot elements are unexplained, you play the same maps over & over again & I honestly never finished the game, turns out I'm not the only one if you check more negative reviews.\\n\\n[h1] This game has sold for as low as $23.99 [/h1]\\n\\nIf you see this game selling for $39.99, you're actually paying more for this game and everyone since shortly after launch. Just beware that you're not getting the best value out of this game, but honestly it's not really worth money imo.\\n\\nThe Demo is actually different from the actual game, so I cannot even tell you to experience the demo first, which is tragic.\\n\\n[h1] Focus Points - Final Thoughts [/h1]\\n\\nIt has been a long time since I played the game, but I still remember firmly why Scarlet Nexus was the worst $60 purchase I made in 2021 & is debatable the worst $60 purchase I've ever made on Steam since being here.\\n\\nThe world does not feel alive, you fee like the only one there, despite living inside of a mega city with several locations, but you're almost always alone when you're going anywhere. The Anime in its first episode changes alot, for example there's a ceremony that actually shows hundreds of OSF graduating, you're not saving the civilians in the first part, established OSF are because you're a recruit. It actually does a better introducing your comrades & showcases them actually saving regular people which never happens in-game.\\n\\nNot a testament to the anime, I just note that in its first episode it did the world building alot better right of the bat.\\n\\nThe game utilizes still images of events rather than rendered cutscenes or low resolution real-time cutscenes like Tales of Arise, and this really hurts the game because it can break the immersion as it's off-putting & the opposite of immersive. Honestly most of the story interactions have these Kinetic Novel storytelling elements in what is supposed to be a 3D Action RPG & as someone who likes Visual Novels, this was poorly done & seemed like an afterthought to save time/cost.\\n\\n(A good game that blends Visual Novel storytelling into an RPG is Death End; Request.)\\n\\nMany Characters act dumb for the sake of the plot, Yuito the protagonist is the mindless MC who chooses to always make dumb decisions so long as they're the happy decisions that require no hardships.\\n\\nI may EDIT this review in the future to add more detail because I'd rather play good games then waste time on this game further, but honestly the reasons I've given are enough, this game was never worth $60 & even now I wouldn't recommend it period.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.5381433125092671, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Game is fantastic and I recommend experiencing it for yourself.

With Yuito the combat is perfectly on point, but with Kasane, you just can't be aggressive.

But despite that, you get to spend a lot of time with everyone, some might argue that it's a bit too much, but since I love dialoges, and character chemistry, I actually felt like by the end that I starve for more. Can't wait for the continuation of the game.(There better be, after setting up the whole future arc, but who knows, there are no news about a code vein sequel either, despite the cliffhanger at the end of the best ending)\\nSO if you like visual novels like me, and you are into anime, especially the edgy ones, I believe you will enjoy this game.

The combat system is pretty boring and doesn't get much better as the game goes on. Environments are a dull set of repeating big rooms for combat separated by corridors. There's a few nice monster designs, but you get tired of them after a few hundred times. Even the characters look so similar to each other, you'll wish to instantly change their skins to some third party game integrated promotional design that has a colour palette that isn't red and black.\\n\\nThe issue with combat is that as you advance, the fights don't get more complicated or require you to get better. Enemies just get padded with more and more HP and armor, so you hit X for longer to get through them. If you thought that you'd get by by just grinding a bit more, think again. Enemy level scales with yours, so being thorough punishes you back. And the weapon upgrades are a linear, story dictated progression of diminishing returns. Each new level of weapon ads 3 more damage points, so relatively to everything else, that's actually diminishing returns. And if you bought the Season Pass, you started the game with weapons that won't have a better version until you're 10 hours into the game at the least.\\n\\nThe plot is a mixed bag. It's another one of those mixed media messes where part of the story is delivered through an Anime series. You even get quests that quiz you on how much you were paying attention, though answers are obviously all over the internet. Apart from that, the story of the game is also split in two because you choose to play as one of two main characters and need to replay the game to see the whole thing.

There's another thing with the art direction and it's how the cutscenes are handled, most of the times they'll be \\\"manga\\\"~like, which imo, gives it a different identity to other 3d JRPGs.\\n\\nSecond, the sound and music, while at first the Dubstep is a bit of a letdown to me, I'm surprised with the amount of bangers there are, specially later on in the game where there are more orchestral tracks rather than dubstep. I still like the Main town theme despite it's dubstep.\\n\\nGameplay, IT'S VERY FUN TO PLAY, there is only one downside tho, playing on Very Hard is a damn punishment lmao, you can get killed by any mistake, I'd say is harder than Modern Ys, but easier than Ys Origin Hard (to make an example). There is only one thing I don't like much about playing on very hard, and that's because some enemies tend to feel like hp sponges, although you can pretty much annihilate them if you rip out their \\\"crush gauge\\\" or take advantage of their weakness as quickly as you can. There's also other features to the gameplay that maintains it fresh without the need of you becoming over powered through new mechanics, so it's very balanced.\\n\\nCharacters: Possibly the highlight for me, character interactions and dynamics are very charming, specially through bonding and team bonding, The confrontation in the story is also a highlight I really liked. Character development is also pretty nice and well done that in a way it can be said that the story is very character driven, which makes it great. There's no petty fanservice, no outrageous tropes, no MC d*ck s*cking.\\n\\nStory: It's not the greatest story ever, but it does hold up and it's done well, I like the futuristic post apocalyptic setting it has, the lore is cool and I did enjoy the plot twists and all the conflicts that came out of it. Also, the amount of consequences in this game is very high, not just that, the stakes feel real (thanks to the game difficulty btw) because you can really feel the weight of an encounter by how hard it is, and that makes a lot of emphasis towards the story and what the characters feel, so that's a plus for me.\\n\\nI did rage here and there, because some enemies specially on very hard are somewhat annoying in certain groups, and the quality of design during the last chapters were a bit underwhelming as it felt as they shoved random enemies along your way, fortunately, the final battle did pay off for that, so I forgave it.\\n\\nOverall, It's a solid 7.5 - 8.5/10 game for me, I still have to play Kasane's route, but I'll get to that once I finish it\\n\\nEdit: I finally played Kasane's route, but first I maxed out everything I could in Yuito's post game, and it made me reconsider most of the things I disliked, like the endgame and some hp sponges enemies, turns out I did restrict myself a lot by not using certain skills that would have made the experience way better (like the multiple active SAS), it made me appreciate more the endgame and the combat as a whole, as I could get rid of sponge enemies faster. \\n\\nI also really liked to connect the dots between Yuito and Kasane' story. I disagree HEAVILY with those people that encourage only to play Kasane, play both, because there are still pretty strong emotional moments in Yuito's story (alongside great bonding and character development on his side) \\n\\nneedless to say that Kasane's story was great too, I really liked the confrontation of the team on this one, that, and the rest of the backstories of the characters through bonding. Definitely a game I would recommend to those that want an unique setting, great characters, great story, power system, gameplay and overall anime jrpg enthusiasts.\\n\\nI'll pick up some dlcs later on, like the Brain Eater DLC as it seems to be a continuation (or to add more to the story)\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.03558086584335275, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Looks like this game's work has a influence from Devil May Cry 5 and Punishing: Gray Raven.

There are a few things I want to touch on though. While I personally do not mind it, a lot of people will find it very jarring to see the cutscenes be 90% comic panel style, with very few actual set pieces. The writing itself is pretty on brand for an anime game: By that, I mean, expect the usual tropes of hyper convoluted terms, lore building, and round about explanations for current events. Sprinkle on top something about the \\\"power of friendship\\\", and there you go. In terms of pacing though, I think tackling things from Yuito's perspective first will provide a bit more context and meaning to the story, and while you could play a game of \\\"pin the personality trope\\\" on each companion character, they're all pretty solid when it comes to the interactions with the main characters.\\n\\nNow for gameplay, ohhhh the gameplay. Early on, it can be frustrating with middling damage and not many points put into skills, but I would say around the 2 hour mark (like the story) it begins to pick up. The name of the game is \\\"Combos\\\", and mixing up companion SAS abilities with additional passive bonuses from your Brain Map and Equipment; you'll start to see results sky rocket. It's flashy, and once you get the hang of it, you'll find yourself pressing a flurry of different button combinations to see a screen filled with enough effects to induce a seizure. That being said though...getting some of the cosmetics, gifts for companions, and better weapons require hefty amounts of grinding, some even requiring game clears to get...for EACH character, not just for the playable ones. To add onto that, levels are huge, providing ample room for movement, but sometimes there's just too much room and enemies are just as mobile as you sometimes, and with no i-frames or animation cancel dodges, you'll most likely find yourself frustrated. \\nThe encounters with enemies can also feel like straight padding. Especially near the end, where it can feel like the game is just desperately throwing you through a gauntlet of enemies almost back to back, especially since early game \\\"boss\\\" enemies become almost as common as mobs later on.\\n\\nBut enough of me complaining, the combat loop can be pretty fun and I'm still in the process of my second playthrough.

This is less a computer game than it is a flirtation with an ancient concept called an 'interactive comic'.   That is, mostly a video of still images interspersed with brief moments of actually doing something to make it feel less like you're just reading.  That notion fell flat on it's face decades ago when reading was still popular and I can't see it working now.  It's basically the equivalent of putting some schmuck on a stage with a stack of pacards, filming him flipping them over, and calling it a 'movie'.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.01280143785248034, \"joke\": 1, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"It's a simple, but polished game.

The combat is more similar to Platinum games, such as [url=store.steampowered.com/app/524220]Nier: Automata[/url] and [b]Astral Chain[/b]. The camera is zoomed out, you move very fast and have an insane amount of mobility, you can double jump and dash twice in mid-air. The combat revolves around chaining attacks into long combos. You have regular attacks (3-4 hits on the ground, 2-3 in the air), a launcher move, as well as psychokinesis (PK) attacks where you pick up nearby objects and slam them into enemies. Essentially you're meant to alternate between melee and PK to keep your combo going as this greatly increases your damage output. Sadly, each protagonist has only one weapon style, a katana for Yuito, and throwing knives for Kasane. And you can't directly control any of the party members either. They are instead used for temporary buffs which add another layer of depth to the system. E.g. you can slow down time, go into stealth and execute sneak attacks, create clones around you to double or triple your attacks, teleport around instead of dashing, imbue your attacks with electricity or fire etc. Late game you're able to activate up to 4 out of 8 of these SAS abilities at once and it gets very fun. There's also a break system and it's possible to kill enemies much faster if you exploit their weaknesses by attacking them in specific ways.\\n\\nNitpicks wise, there's no animation cancelling, you have to commit to your attacks just like in Souls, except the game is trying to be a spectacle fighter so this restriction feels weirdly punishing. You're busy combo'ing an enemy, see a projectile coming your way, but there's nothing you can do about it. And the dodge has no i-frames anyway and is really just a dash. There's a perfect dodge mechanic where you dodge really close to (but not through) an enemy hitbox and the game will slow down and let you counter, but this is more like a parry. Also, the majority of bosses are humans and not very fun to fight as they mostly use player animations and thus barely have any tells. The big monster fights are really good though.\\n\\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\\nThe game is set in a really stylish post-apocalyptic brainpunk world. Every area is a joy to look at and the two city hubs are absolutely stunning. The environments are filled to the brim with lots of small details and cover many different locales ranging from run down East Asian cityscape (very reminiscent of the first [b]Ghost in the Shell[/b] movie which was based on the 90's Hong Kong ghettos) to snowy mountains to gothic ruins. Characters use high poly cel shaded models giving them a [b]Persona 5[/b] like look, but more modern and polished. All combat animations are extremely well done and very fluid, just simply moving your character around and jumping feels very good.\\n\\nThe cutscenes are a bit divisive though. The game uses stop animation for the majority of its cutscenes. There are unique key animations and poses for most of the scenes, and it's all done in real time (so that you can see your custom outfits), but they're still essentially just comic book panels. Personally, I didn't mind this stylistic choice. And big story moments are fully animated with motion capture.\\n\\nOf note, the game is very well optimized and will run well even on lower spec systems. It's using Unreal Engine 4 and the PC port has absolutely no issues, everything just works.\\n\\n[h1]Story[/h1]\\nThe story is... wild. If you love anime and sci-fi tropes you're going to enjoy it, because the writers used every cool sci-fi trope they could think of and the story gets completely bonkers with bizarre twists and reveals in almost every chapter. You get to pick one of two protagonists, a boy named Yuito, and a girl named Kasane, and each of them has their own party of 4, but the two stories happen at the same time, so many of the plot points will be shared. And late game, both parties will combine into one. Since the cast is so large, there are numerous Persona like bonding episodes to help flesh out the characters, and each of the protagonists gets completely unique scenes with both platoons. Personally, I enjoyed the characters and their interactions, but some plot developments felt a bit rushed. A single story playthrough with all bond episodes will take 40-50 hours.\\n\\n[h1]Yuito vs Kasane[/h1]\\nIf you're only planning on playing through the game once I recommend picking the girl, Kasane. Yuito's story has quite a few blank spots (due to him not getting any [spoiler]time travel[/spoiler] segments), so his side of the story may seem incoherent, while Kasane's is the full experience with no questions left unanswered. Gameplay wise, Kasane is a mid-range character and more fun to play, while Yuito is close range and will need to run up close to each enemy. And finally, Kasane has an actual personality, whereas Yuito is your typical Mr. Shounen Protagonist who's na\\u00efve and wide-eyed in every scene and shows no growth throughout the whole game. It almost feels like the game was written with only Kasane in mind and Yuito was added later to provide a male protagonist option. And the sequel hook at the end of the game again revolves around Kasane.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.032917755829672914, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"This game is so much fun.

Playing the demo gives you a good enough taste of the game to let you know whether or not it appeals to you. If you pick up the game, I recommend that you only play through Kasane\\u2019s story path for reasons explained below.\\n\\nRegarding the two different story paths (Yuito Story and Kasane Story), the general consensus is that you should go through Yuito\\u2019s story first and save Kasane\\u2019s story for last, but I STRONGLY disagree with it. Play Kasane\\u2019s story and skip Yuito\\u2019s story entirely. If you really like Yuito, then by all means play his story, but Kasane\\u2019s story felt like the actual main story while Yuito\\u2019s story felt like an unnecessary introduction to the world of Scarlet Nexus. Yuito and his story was written to be as approachable and non-abrasive as possible, which is apparent from looking at Yuito\\u2019s very sincere and emotional personality. A recent interview with Miyajima Takumi, one of the lead scenario writers for Scarlet Nexus, even explicitly states that this was the approach Yuito and his story was created with. \\n\\nAs an unfortunate result, Yuito\\u2019s story has very dry dialogue that doesn\\u2019t allow for any of the characters in his story to show their personalities or have nice dynamics with other characters. Despite the fact that what happens in his story is fairly relevant to him, Yuito feels like he\\u2019s just going through the motions of the plot and feels disconnected from the story, with his passive nice guy personality making him come off as a \\\"generic action anime protag\\\" as that's all you ever get to see of him barring 1 or 2 moments that can be missed by the player.\\n\\nFrom what I\\u2019ve seen, people recommend Yuito\\u2019s story first because of the sense of mystery you get from what\\u2019s unexplained in Yuito\\u2019s story and because of Yuito\\u2019s ease of play. But Scarlet Nexus\\u2019s narrative feels much more suited to how Kasane\\u2019s story is told, where the pieces and facts of the story are laid out plainly in front of you instead of being hidden when they gain no major benefit from being hidden. And since Yuito and Kasane more or less play and control the same with slight differences, there\\u2019s not much left exclusive to Yuito\\u2019s story path that\\u2019s worth your time. \\n\\nThe most significant thing you would miss are Yuito\\u2019s Bond Episodes (short side stories with other characters). If you\\u2019re really itching to see Yuito\\u2019s Bond Episodes (which are ok overall but not as great as Kasane\\u2019s), then search them up on YouTube. I personally think that viewing content on YouTube is inferior to experiencing it yourself when possible, but Yuito\\u2019s story path does not have nearly enough meat for you to go through it just for his Bond Episodes. Other than that, you will not miss anything significant to the story or gameplay by only playing Kasane\\u2019s story and skipping Yuito\\u2019s story entirely. I highly recommend that you do this if you are willing.\\n\\nKasane\\u2019s story path has her going on a journey for more compelling reasons than Yuito, so I found myself invested in the plot\\u2019s progression as soon as things were in motion. Kasane\\u2019s story makes the game\\u2019s central theme of the connections between people hit more effectively with the standoffish Kasane traveling and slowly bonding with characters that are allowed to have their personalities shine through in both the main story and Kasane\\u2019s Bond Episodes (which are really good). Kasane feels like a complete main character with how physically and emotionally involved she is in the narrative. What really pointed this out to me was how Kasane finds herself facing relevant and similar struggles to the main antagonist of Scarlet Nexus that help tie into the game\\u2019s main theme later on for a satisfying payoff, whereas Yuito barely interacts with the game\\u2019s main antagonist and stumbles his way into relevancy during the second half of his story.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s talk about the combat of Scarlet Nexus. The combat gives you just a few options at the beginning to work with but you quickly find yourself having tons of different attacks to style on enemies with. If there was a sequel for this game, I\\u2019d like to see more physical and power attack options for the protagonist character. Two gripes I had with the combat is that the counterattack after a perfect dodge is very weak by itself (there are certain ways in the game to power it up however) and that the perfect dodge can be strict with its activation, especially if the enemy\\u2019s attack hits at an awkward angle. You can make do without frequent use of it as your run speed is fast and there\\u2019s other options for evading/nullifying enemy attacks but it definitely needs some adjustments in my opinion. Despite these gripes, I had a ton of fun with Scarlet Nexus\\u2019s combat. The animation quality, visual effects, and focus towards obliterating your enemies in the most efficiently flashy way possible had me hooked for the length of the game.\\n\\nFor my difficulty mode, I played on Hard, which was surprisingly enjoyable. The damage and HP values aren\\u2019t jacked up insanely high, so while you definitely take more damage, you can still hit the enemies very hard (including bosses). FYI, I would not recommend playing the Very Hard mode that was added after release. It doesn\\u2019t make any significant changes to things such as enemy patterns or moves. It felt like a slog for the short time I tried it. Choose Normal or Hard as your difficulty if you want a fun and challenging experience. On the topic of bosses, I\\u2019m really glad that bosses were designed to be fair yet challenging. There\\u2019s a way to dodge or deal with every attack a boss has (barring maybe one boss in Yuito\\u2019s path, it was pretty annoying dealing with their attacks). There\\u2019s also ways to stagger or immobilize the bosses so that you have the chance to deal big damage to them with a proper combo.\\n\\nI\\u2019d really like to see a sequel for Scarlet Nexus in the future. There\\u2019s good groundwork in place for a sequel with Kasane as the main protagonist, or perhaps someone related to her in the far future. The gameplay would also benefit very much from additions and adjustments to what\\u2019s already there. I enjoyed my time with this game very much and I hope you try it out.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.046426086468497066, \"joke\": 1, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Hist\\u00f3ria - 7/10\\nGr\\u00e1ficos - 8/10\\nJogabilidade - 10/10\\nSom - 9/10\\nNota Final 8.5/10\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.5944206134457177, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"A modest action adventure anime-style game featuring 2 intertwining stories: 1 revolving Kasane, a female protagonist who cares a lot about her sister.

During combat, you can temporarily utilize special powers (called SAS) of your teammates to decimate the enemies.

Fortunately you can recap the plot in the menu if you are confused, and a character description telling you the background so you wouldn't forget who's who.\\n\\nUnfortunately there's also next to no interesting activities around the towns as well beyond side quests with no much variation.

It presents an intriguing (and at times confusing) story centered around a group of soldiers in the distant future using innate abilities to combat beings called \\u2018others\\u2019.\\n\\nI would describe this game as \\u2018cool\\u2019. Fending off monsters with a sword you control through telekinesis or crushing them with whatever object you can find to yeet on the battlefield is great fun on its own. But, when you combine that with a total of 9 different abilities that you can toggle on and off at any time is when things start to get interesting. Maybe that aforementioned sword is on fire, or those objects are actually duplicated whenever you throw them? Better yet, what if you were also moving at supersonic speed whilst you were doing all that? When it all comes together, like I said, it\\u2019s just pretty damn cool.\\n\\nThat is only amplified by the stunning visual effects. Scarlet Nexus isn\\u2019t pushing the boundaries graphically, but it oozes style in every frame. I particularly love the character cut-ins you get when you borrow an ally\\u2019s power. The colours are vibrant and informative, and every new location has a distinct visual palette. The character design is also good here, humans have distinct silhouettes and adopt a style that I feel represents their personality well. The others also have incredibly unique and diverse looks, and can be outright unsettling to look at sometimes, in a good way!\\n\\nHowever, whilst the effects look great, I do find they are sometimes a bit overbearing. At times, it can be difficult to see what is happening on the screen, which has proved to be fatal for me more than once.\\n\\nThis brings me onto the combat as a whole. The enemies you are facing have well defined strengths and weaknesses, and you have a large arsenal of powers to combat them with to boot. However, I did feel my interest in combat start to wane towards the end of the game - for all the amazing abilities and cool effects at your disposal, at the end of the day all the combat really boils down to is attack - throw - attack - throw - attack\\u2026 And so on, with whatever abilities you choose to use thrown in between. This is largely kept afloat by the spectacle, but it can feel repetitive, especially when you consider the length of the game.\\n\\nWhich leads to my next point, the game is too long. I don\\u2019t hate games that take more time than most to complete, but that time has to be engaging throughout, otherwise it\\u2019s pointless. Unfortunately, in my opinion Scarlet Nexus drags on a bit too much during the middle part of the story, which isn\\u2019t helped by the fact that you have to play the game again, doing largely similar encounters with a different character to get both halves of the story (it took me about 50 hours total to do both, pretty much speed-running the second play-through). A large portion of this time is also not spent actually playing the game, but rather reading through conversations with characters. These aren\\u2019t always boring, and can actually be interesting explorations of dynamics between characters, the problem is the balance between dialogue and gameplay does not feel right.\\n\\nThe main story is engaging, but at times the large dumps of info are just outright confusing, which isn\\u2019t helped by the extremely complex nature of the plot. It can also be hard to understand characters' motivations for their actions, especially since the second play-through contains much needed context for the first. Some characters also feel sidelined in the story (Kodama and Fubuki for example), in favour of plotlines which I feel go unresolved for too long. For what it\\u2019s worth, I do think the game has strong emotional moments and a satisfying ending which resolves most characters\\u2019 stories.\\n\\nOn a positive note, the sound design is awesome. All the powers and others have audio that represents them well, and characters have good Japanese voice-acting. The music goes pretty hard too\\u2026 It\\u2019s surprisingly jazzy outside of combat, but the heavier tracks come in whilst you\\u2019re smashing up enemies to add to that spectacle just a little bit more. I wouldn\\u2019t say anything stands out massively, but it\\u2019s all up to par.\\n\\nOverall, it\\u2019s a good game that I\\u2019d recommend if you\\u2019re a fan of these types of games. Just be wary of the time commitment needed if you want to see both sides of the story\\u2026 And maybe pace yourself through all the conversations.\\n\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.02902349880380971, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Unexpectedly beautiful.\\n\\nThe gameplay is fresh and original, the story is awesome and the narrative has a intriguing pace.

Where do I start? With the obvious, I guess. This game has arguably the best visuals I have ever seen in an anime-style game. I mean the graphics are great and so is the drawing style. Cutscenes are replaced by manga-like images but that's okay too. There's a bit too much of these, though, and they happen a little too frequently for my taste and thus can, like, interrupt your gameplay experience. However, this wouldn't be too bad if the story was great, right? Let's talk about the story then. \\n\\nThis game is set in a world, where there's basically two cities, that are under constant threat from Others, monsters that fall from the sky and feed on human brains. To combat these, the so-called OSF was formed. It's members have so-called powers, basically magic abilities. Telepathy for example, or psychokinesis, which the two main characters both have. Powers seem to be an important part of this society as well. They're used to communicate with one another (called Brain Link) and even to read signs. Those who don't posess powers are called \\\"duds\\\" and are treated as some kind of second-class citizens. That's the basic premise of the story. \\n\\nAt the start of the game you can choose between Yuito Sumeragi, the male protagonist, and Kasane Randall, the female protagonist, respectively. They both have the same power, which is psychokinesis, as I mentioned.  This means that they can pick up objects and throw them at enemies. In addition to that, they have an additional weapon that they can use. While Yuito fights with a sword and specializes in melee combat, Kasane has throwing-knive like things that she can hurl at enemies from mid-range. \\nOther than that, there's a diverse cast of support characters. Up to two of them can assist you in combat. But basically, they only exist to allow you to borrow their abilities. Spice psychokinesis with pyrokinesis, and suddenly the debris flying in the face of the enemy is burning and incinerates the enemy, inflicting additional damage, But more on combat later. For now, let's continue with the story. Or rather on the question, whom of the characters to choose. The answer is one, or both. Hear me out. If you choose Yuito, the story revolves around...well, him. His past, his actions and the consequences of that. However, you won\\u2019t experience the full story if you choose Yuito. Kasanes story, on the contrary, deals with more of the problems that society has. It gives you a more complete overview of the world the game takes place in. So if you want to experience the most story in the shortest amount of time, choose her. If you want the complete picture, choose both. \\nBoth storylines don\\u2019t diverge too much, however. You visit the same places and in the end you have the same companions and can choose abilities from the same pool. For, like, half the game, the story actually is the same.\\n\\nRight. Now that you\\u2019ve chosen a character, what is there to do? Fight, obviously. But let\\u2019s save that for the next part. Apart from that, you can roam the two cities and\\u2026well. Explore them. There really isn\\u2019t much else to do other than roam the streets and talk to NPC. What else can you do? You can interact with your companions. Each one of them has a different personality, ranging from an utter scumbag to somewhat of the mother of the group. Somewhat cliche, but likeable mostly.  Between each chapter there is a so-called standby phase, where you can bond with specific characters. In these bond episodes, you basically get to know them better. Sometimes, they request special missions, where you fight Others with them. With each bond level you unlock more powerful abilities that you can use, when synched with that character. Or passive benefits, like longer skill duration. You can customize their appearance as well, if that\\u2019s what you fancy. \\nCharacters aren\\u2019t the only ones who sometimes request your assistance. Various NPC do so as well. However, their quests usually come down to the same formula. Defeat monster x with method y. \\nSpeaking of methods, let\\u2019s move on to the meat of this game. Combat. Fighting happens in real time, and involves both mouse buttons. Left button for attacks, right button for telekinesis. Then there is a somewhat special attack on C, a finishing move once the enemy has no armour on G, and the various skills you can borrow. Then there is an ability called Brain Drive that activates involuntarily and gives you a boost on your abilities, and another one called brain field. That one, you need to activate on your own when the gauge becomes full. Inside the brain field, your attacks wield devastating power, but you need to discontinue the field in, like, 30 seconds, or you die. Not mentioning assault vision, where a team member performs a special attack, guard vision and\\u2026did I get my point across? It\\u2019s far too much to choose from. Especially in such dynamic battles. \\nSo. Is it worth it? I think it is. I wouldn\\u2019t consider this a hidden gem or the pinnacle of anime games or RPG, but it sure is fun. A bit repetitive, but still fun. \\n\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.01563227066171332, \"joke\": 1, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"The gameplay is fun, but I think some cutscene and dialogue are too long, in most of my session, I can spent 30 minutes just to watch cutscene.

I went in hoping for something decent but the game really underwhelmed me.\\n\\nStory:\\nThe story in this game is anime nonsense if you like that sort of thing. In general I like goofy anime stories but I really had trouble getting into this one. Maybe it picks up towards the middle but where I'm at it feels disjointed and I don't really care about any of the characters or their motivations.\\n\\nCombat:\\nBefore starting this game I had heard that the combat was amazing but I personally don't see what others do. \\n\\nThe main flow of combat revolves around mixing your normal attacks with psychic attacks. Normal attacks feel fluid but are very underwhelming damage wise. Your psychic attack then involves holding down a button to throw random debris at enemies. Using your basic attacks fills your psychic meter which lets you throw more rocks as you weave in and out of melee range. Repeat until monsters are dead.\\n\\nDoing the flashy combos with my floating blades looked really cool and was fun but did next to no damage compared to throwing rocks at enemies. I found using the psychic powers to throw rocks really un-fun. To hurl the debris you have to root yourself in place which ruined any rhythm I was getting into and took away my ability to dodge which lead to me getting hit a bunch. Unfortunately if you don't throw rocks, you don't do damage. I was using the female lead, the male lead has a sword instead of the floating daggers. Maybe his weapon sucked less but I never tried it.\\n\\nYou get allies in your party that give you access to other psychic powers which amount to short term buffs as you link up and borrow their psychic powers. For example linking up with the person with pyrokinesis adds fire damage to all your attacks. It's pretty fun but doesn't really change how you play except some powers are made to counter certain enemies. Where I was at I never really had a chance to pick who I wanted in my party and it was mostly dictated by the story. I imagine later on it opens up more after they've forced you to try using every power.\\n\\nEventually the game tells you about enemies break meter which if you deplete stuns them and lets you execute them instantly killing them or doing big damage larger enemies. Doing the execute has a small cutscene where you rip the enemies apart with your mind which looks cool but gets tedious really fast. What annoyed me was that whenever you broke an enemy they become immune to further damage to let you perform the execute. This lead to a few situations where the enemy would have died but I had to take the cinematic approach when I'd rather just move on faster.\\n\\nAtmosphere:\\nThis was my favorite part of the game. If you've watched any of the trailers the game promises a certain style and it delivers on what it promised. Everything you do in combat looks cool, the monsters look alien and creepy, and the music is fantastic. The look and feel of the game is what made me want to keep playing but style alone only gets you so far. Thankfully there's an anime if you want the style without the game play.\\n\\nOverall:\\nGame is okay, not great but not the worst thing I've played. Would not recommend paying full price but maybe it's worth it if you find a good sale. There's a demo now so try that first or if you have game pass just go play it there.\\n\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.053877036773152386, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"You play as John and or Jill Scarlet Nexus and you walk around Detroit for 80 hours and hear the phrases \\\"from the moon\\\" and or \\\"2000 years\\\" enough times to cause an aneurysm.\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.5894883983574101, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Negative\", \"review_text\": \"Boring.

However, the story itself feels a bit thrown together randomly (lot of plot holes) and the pacing is all over the place.

There is a cool relationship building mechanic where you can buy/give gifts and watch \\\"bond\\\" episodes which develops the characters and their relationship with the protagonists throughout the game; I've been enjoying that a lot. The leveling and weapon upgrade systems aren't that unique or rewarding but at least it doesn't require a significant/painful grind. The dodge mechanic and timing is awful, and the recovery time after you get knocked down is even worse (very frustrating). I'm only about halfway through the first plot of the game and only now just getting used to evade timings and counter attacks. I will continue to play through both protagonist story lines.

The game's strongest sides are really just the visual quality and the music but other then that it feels like a project from a team that tried to do their best on a limited budget. \\n\\nThe combat gets very boring and repetitive much too fast with character upgrades only leading to the same result of seeing the same brain crush animations to finish enemies constantly. Ally NPCs that are really just for show as they don't contribute anything during combat outside maybe healing you. Gear also plays no real big factor into how your character feels so you will have a very static experience outside the 2 playable characters having very minor playstyle differences.\\n\\nCutscenes are something I am very conflicted on for this game because most are not animated and simply use still images and lightly animated character portraits at times. This is part of why I said it feels as though the game was working around a very poor budget, because when it DOES go to fully animated parts it does so with great transitions and really showcases some production quality talent. The character models are great, the camera choices are great, the sound is great, the sense of scale some key scenes give is great, and everything feels very naturally expressive. It feels so hard to decide whether or not those budget scenes let the big ones shine or if we got denied more high quality scenes due to budget.\\n\\nLast big thing make or break section for the experience here is obviously gonna be the story itself when we put the gameplay and presentation aside. And sadly that is probably the biggest failure for the game. Both character's you can play as are basically 2 sides of the same coin here but not equal. The Yuito story quickly takes a sharp turn to confusing and jarring as you have things going on that you have no context or understanding for and it never manages to recover from that feeling once it begins because that route simply isn't where anything really comes to light. Meanwhile the Kasane route consistently handles itself leagues better, giving plenty of context around all events with better pacing and detail. But regardless of if you do either one of these routes or both, you won't get anything more then what the Kasane route offers. Your efforts to see everything through will not be rewarded. \\n\\nPlot holes remain, stuff gets swept under the rug, choices and events remain jarring, and ultimately everything you learn about the dark sides of the key governments and organizations just takes the side role so you can stop the bad guy that isn't really the bad guy so that your party can all have a happy ending that isn't an ending but them all going on to tackle these vague issues that you as a player never get to really explore.\\n\\nTldr, only buy if the game is on a big sale so you waste less money with an experience maybe cheaper games can beat.\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.008082927351449993, \"joke\": 1, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Goddamit Karen\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.02322539053570418, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Very Good\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.03247491044790925, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Great Game.

The combat is super dynamic and moves at a high speed, but it gives you just enough of a breather to not be overwhelming. Usually inbetween all the hacking and slashing you will be doing a short QTE or watching a cinematic animation of your character's finishing moves. Using telekenesis never gets old and the other powers are great too, there are some really fun synergies you can do once all of the powers are unlocked. The progression of your character is pretty satisfying too, as you unlock more abilities the combat just gets extra layers of fun. On a mechanical level, everything has great impact, the objects you throw at enemies feel like they have some substantial weight and its really satisfying to land your attacks. Some special telekenetic attacks are especially great. At some point you are able to grab a bus and steer it into your enemies, which felt amazing. \\n\\nAnother good thing is the hideout. Inbetween plot missions you get to hang out at your hideout where you can do bond episodes with characters as well as give them gifts. The gift part was great, once you give a gift to a character they will usually interact with it in a fun way. For example if you give a magician's hat to Kagero, he will use his invisibility while wearing the hat, so you jsut see a floating hat. Over the course of the game your hideout will fill up with various decorations and feel a lot more lively as more and more characters show up there. This along with the bond episodes does help you get into the characters a lot more.\\n\\nThere are a couple of things here that aren't great though. Environment design is pretty boring, there is not much exploration and all the levels are linear. This is probably the biggest issue with the game, however it didn't necessarily ruin the experience for me, because the combat was so engaging I just kept wanting to go back to fighting.\\n\\nThe items are almost completely useless, except for the healing potions. This is partially because the game is nowhere near difficult enough to need some of the items and the other reason is that you never really wan't to slow down the pace of the fight by selecting the item and using it.\\n\\nThe customization is honestly awful. There are essentially no costumes to choose from and the small accessories that you can put on your character don't make up for it. You get to upgrade your weapon a decent bit, but visually it barely changes. This is the biggest fault of this game in my opinion because it takes away a lot from the RPG element of the game.\\n\\nThe story is highly subjective. Some moments were interesting and even memorable, but overall the story is confusing in places. Most characters are sort of flat and stereotypical, but they are still enjoyable enough. Out of the large cast of side characters the ones that stood out to me the most were Gemma, Kagero and Tsugumi. Gemma had an interesting side story with some pretty decent character development. The main protagonists are both pretty dull, your generic shonen guy with a good heart and stoic/cool anime girl. The story is honestly not terrible, but if you aren't a fan of generic anime plotlines, it might ruin the game for you.\\n\\nOverall the game has been pretty refreshing because of it's combat and it definitely had me coming back for more. Give it a go if you can overlook the boring environment design and questionable plotline.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.030238573826833464, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Fun game\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.02399111450505758, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Good fast-paced combat and good story\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.12130607362753601, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"A fairly standard JRPG with extremely well designed characters and surprisingly unremarkable world & story.\\nCombo-based hack&slash style gameplay, organized into theme dungeons, with tons of useful items (and cosmetics) to collect and upgrade, interrupted with sections of VN-style storytelling.\\nThere is clearly a detailed world behind this game's story, but it only gets explored on the surface, as storytelling drowns in cringey anime plot twists and a fairly standard \\\"world is dommed\\\" storyline. It feels like the writers attempted to tell something unique about time travel, but it got so diluted in typical science-fantasy bullshit and predictable developments that it loses all value.\\nWhich is, to some degree, offset by amazing character stories and \\\"Bond Episodes\\\" - sets of stories focused on each of side characters. The full cast in this game is unusually large, and despite that, every single character is well designed and fits well with the rest. There is a gameplay mechanism around bonding with friends (though not as deep as, say, Persona games) which, despite the tremendous dissonance of spending time on casual activities while the world is about to end, pushed me through the game and had me constantly anticipating next \\\"break period\\\" which you can spend socializing. The quality of the writing of these stories varies, but is very good in general, with some excellent moments.\\nBefore I got this game, I did not expect I'd enjoy the art style as much as I did. All environments are beautifully designed and shaded, almost to the point where I'd consider the dungeons \\\"atmospheric\\\", if it wasn't for the constant onslaught of enemies that distract from sightseeing.\\nDespite a pretty steep learning curve, I ended up enjoying the combo-based fighting style, especially since a few chapters into the story, where all powers become available. It's difficult to master, and especially on harder difficulties I can see this game giving a lot of challenge. However, the easy mode available in game settings is actually easy, which I really appreciated in some of the toughest fights where the casual gamer that I am stopped enjoying the relentless need to precisely dodge attacks from some bosses.\\nIt's not a souls-like, though, by any measure. I have no idea why people keep comparing SCARLET NEXUS to Dark Souls, I see zero similarities, except maybe that the hard difficulty is actually hard, and the rich and varied enemy and boss design (which, while impressive, doesn't even get close to souls levels). So don't get this this to stroke your souls itch, it's a JRPG by all standards, and a pretty traditional one at that, although unusually polished.\\nI played the English dub, because the characters speak a lot during fights when you can't be distracted to read subtitles for the Japanese audio. With some minor exceptions, I found all VAs somewhat above the average. No character stood out to me as particularly well voiced, but there is little to complain either, so it's a well rounded performance overall that almost never disrupts the immersion.\\nMy only complaint is that many chapters are long, and the game starts to feel grindy at times. Not to mention the grind necessary to find resources for gifts which unlock character stories... that probably wasn't my favorite way of spending time, but the reward in form of these charming bond episodes definitely made up for it.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.014830985120491826, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"9/10. \\n2 for the combat\\n3 for party members.\\n4 for stable gameplay, seriously.

Definitely recommend on sale or if you're a fan of action games and sci-fi anime. Probably not bearable if you don't like anime-style cel-shaded graphics.\\n\\nMost of the action is fun and extremely slick looking. The basic movesets for Kasane and Yuito aren't that deep and are mostly gated behind point purchases in a sprawling skill grid that allows you to ignore abilities that feel like they should be core for way too long. However the game more than makes up with this with a few neat tricks (psychokinetic attacks requiring charge-up but being chargeable while executing basic combos was a really good move imo), loads of special objects with unique psychokinetic attacks (spinning up the chandeliers in the not-Umbrella-mansion to 10,000 RPM and then sending them careening through enemies was a favorite), and myriad special attacks accessed by combining your powers with those of your team, which is a big chunk of the gameplay that shouldn't be ignored. Companion abilities enhance the PC or even the whole team and often have significant interplay with enemy abilities and the environment - Arashi's hyperspeed counters a lot of enemy defensive reactions by allowing you to strike faster than they can turtle up or flee, Shiden's lightning attacks gain bonuses against enemies soaked by main character psychokinetic attacks, and players used to getting lots of sneak attacks with Kagero's invisibility powers will get a rude surprise if they try to use them against a team that includes a clairvoyant.\\n\\nIf team fights with lots of ability interplay or special command actions represent the gameplay's strongest point, the weakest usually appears when fighting single human opponents, who often have gratuitous hp pools and few vulnerabilities or susceptibility to hitstun, leaving the player to just chip away at them with a few normal attacks at a time. This might be my own lack of skill speaking, but I feel that part of the issue here is that the lack of a dodge cancel tends to favor more conservative play on some of the harder fights, when the ideal for an action game is that the cooler something looks the more beneficial it should be to pull it off.\\n\\nThe game's writing is nothing special. If you can sit through your average anime episode or MCU movie it won't kill you, but this is definitely more 'action' than 'rpg'. Some of the character writing was better than I expected - the highest compliment I can probably pay here is that the characters who seemed most annoying when they were introduced, Shiden and Kagero, eventually became favorites for me - but on the other hand when the game goes for big emotional moments they tend to fall extremely flat ('we'll save his brain... by replacing his memories with our memories of him... power of friendship!' Gag).\\n\\nOverall the social aspect of the game is pretty irrelevant, with only a few of the interactions being interesting (I really wish they had done more with the Kasane route stuff where she's interacting with Yuito's teammates) but i do like how most of the gifts you can give characters are displayed around the characters' safe house.\\n\\nWhile base outfit choices are pretty limited the characters do get dedicated slots for cosmetic-only accessories so you can customize their looks a bit.

As of writing this I just finished Yuito's play through.  \\n\\nThis game very much reminded me of my experience with Tales of Arise.  The game starts out strong.  The story was intriguing at the start and I wanted to learn more about the world.  I enjoyed most of the characters I was being introduced to but had no care for a few.  As you get into it more, the story quickly degrades.  Every \\\"plot twist\\\" was obvious hours ahead of time and yet the characters are blown away when they happen and it just removes you from the game.  Some plot elements that are introduced never come up again or have any pay off.  Then, around the 15-16 hour mark, which ended up being half way in, it becomes very clear very that the devs recognized that if they kept the same pacing as they had to this point, that they would only have enough story to last another hour, maybe 2 at most.  To remedy that they then shift the pacing of the game by making every new location have multiple gigantic floors, with a lot of repetitive battles against enemies that end up taking longer to kill than I care for.  You essentially run through floors with 7-10 obvious battle rooms that raise barriers around them to restrict your passage until you spend the time to kill everything, then go to the next room, etc. until you reach the next floor, where they start having 5-7 floors, and do it over and over again.  By doing this they made design decisions to act as an anchor that the player has to drag through the next 15 hours of the game.  The story in that last half has several things that make little sense, are never explained, or don't make sense with what happened and was explained previously but the characters I did like made me not mind that so much.\\n\\nI will say that the combat itself was enjoyable but you are going to unlock 95% of everything you can do by 20 hours in, if not earlier, and you will then be repeating the same patterns for the rest of the game.\\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed the first half of the game.  The second half was a dragged out bore fest that made me consider not completing the play through several times.  If you had asked me at 10 hours in if I was going to play Kasane's play through I would have said, \\\"Absolutely\\\".  Right now I no longer feel like doing that.  I might do it up until a specific story point to see things from her perspective and then I will quit.   I definitely am not going to sit through an \\\"EX New Game\\\".\\n\\nEdit: I want to add that I had an item to double my EXP that came with the package I bought.  I didn't start using it until level 18 as I felt like the enemies were beginning to outpace me in level growth, and I found the enemies throughout the rest of the game and myself then stayed relatively even for our levels.  I can't say for certain but I worry that they designed the game with that item in mind, and more grind in mind for people that didn't buy it.  That is pure speculation though.\\n\\nEdit 2: I played for 4 more hours doing an EX New Game to see Kasane's unique content.  There was so little unique content by 4 hours in that I decided that I no longer care to see the rest and will not be playing any longer.  I did notice in that run however that the level 20 enemies do the same damage to my level 63 character as the level 60+ enemies were in the first play through.  I also am causing equal damage numbers to them.  The only difference is that the level 20 enemies do not have the larger HP pools that the level 60 enemies do.  That makes sense though when you stop and consider that the stat difference between some of your weaker weapons and better ones is only 30-40 points.  Levels only exist to give the enemies more HP and the player points to unlock skills.  Balance for stats, etc. doesn't exist.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.04223265792841145, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"something between dmc and nier automata, good game with a lot dialogs\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.5485180637548769, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Scarlet Nexus is not a masterpiece but what it is is a stepping stone for the next game, which may very well be.

Tries to do a lot of interesting things, stumbles at times, but is a pretty neat game with glimmers of something more. I consider it worth to pick up on a sale for around $25-30 USD (~50% off release retail price).\\n\\nScarlet Nexus is a surprising gem of a game, although I think its ambitiousness caused the execution to stumble at times.\\n\\nI found the gameplay deeper than expected. The game gradually feeds more mechanics to you for the first half of the game, and then sets you free for the second half. The combat does take some getting used to, it\\u2019s really not in the spirit of a hack-and-slash, even though it may give off this impression. You definitely are locked into your actions once they\\u2019ve started, and you can get knocked out of them very easily. So combat is more about the timing of behavior rather than the reaction-based type of combat of attacking and dodging incoming moves as they come. You are expected to chain moves together in certain sequences to achieve optimal results. Psychokinesis leads to a rush attack in, play out your attack combo, finish with your special to recover Psychokinesis gauge, and then repeat from the start. It\\u2019s engaging to think of the battlefield and identify key targets, etc. That is what the intention seemed to be, anyway. More on that later.\\n\\nSimilarly, the plot drops pretty big reveals on you, but simultaneously doesn\\u2019t go too in-depth with them. It\\u2019s more like shaking you out of your expected comfort zone and going, \\u201cHey, here\\u2019s some fridge horror. Here\\u2019s a new realization and perspective of the world you\\u2019re playing in. Here\\u2019s a revelation.\\u201d It\\u2019s nothing deep, definitely nothing I\\u2019d even sort of consider commentary, but that\\u2019s perfectly okay. It doesn\\u2019t pretend like it\\u2019s a mastercraft of plot, you can predict some things a decent amount of time before they happen, but the story does have a few things to pull out of its sleeve. There\\u2019s a light overarching theme of bonds and connections that comes to a nice payoff, but doesn\\u2019t come off too strongly during the setup over the course of the game.\\n\\nThe telling of the story is interesting in that it mixes visual novel-style screens with actual in-game model cutscenes. The visual novel style is used very creatively at times, using smaller screens and moving within the monitor to set up pans or convey movement. On the other hand, occasionally it just kind of dumps you back into the game without any real transition. Really odd how the quality bounces back and forth at times. Again, why I say the game is rather ambitious but stumbles in its attempt. Visually overall, pretty cool looking. Enemy design is totally awesome and unique. Protagonist designs are a bit eh. They all wear mildly differing uniforms, but they are still uniforms, so it\\u2019s a little forgettable. Some nice stylish moments when you power up. Aesthetic on point overall. Music is neat too, nice beat, although not too memorable.\\n\\nSo, what\\u2019s not so great about the game?\\nTwo characters to choose from, with plots running in parallel. I chose Kasane to start with, the female main character, as her playstyle seemed more appealing. It seems that this was both a boon and a curse. Kasane\\u2019s plotline pretty much captures all the interesting bits, and I don\\u2019t feel like I\\u2019m particularly curious about Yuito\\u2019s plotline. The characters discuss things pretty clearly, so the only thing I would be in the dark is how exactly is that information first discovered. As it happens, that is also something I can more or less piece together. The game hooks you in early with a mystery but soon feeds you the answers without really producing any new questions. Kasane\\u2019s story really just encapsulates everything important, and her odd personality helps to soothe my suspension of disbelief over the more\\u2026 iffy parts of the story telling. So, I don\\u2019t really feel the need to New Game+ and go back for the second character\\u2019s story. \\n\\nGameplay is strange. You are locked into the animation for a lot of your moves, which makes dodging as a whole rather unsatisfying. I still don\\u2019t really understand how \\u201cperfect dodging\\u201d works at all, since running around and waiting for a better moment to attack seems to work well. Are there significant invincibility-frames in the dodge? Seems more akin to Monster Hunter, where there are i-frames, but dodging is more about making space. This is relevant for early game. It feels a bit frustrating in the restrictions, but I like the idea of having to consider the battlefield and make tactical decisions. Oh, but then you also can\\u2019t limitlessly combo Psychokinesis attacks and physical attacks back-to-back. There are options in the skill tree to allow you to combo them more times, but the game starts you in a limited state. And then late game, when you actually do have the ability, you need it less since the game gives you more options for attack. Now it\\u2019s not about how well you execute combat as your playable character with team powerup synergy, it\\u2019s just, activate team powerups, and kind of brute force through enemies with their weaknesses. It\\u2019s quite thrilling to play as you approach and reach this level of power, but then\\u2026 that\\u2019s the game. Rather than creative power uses, it just feels like it boils down to rock, paper, scissors with a health bar. For the next several hours. The combat starts to feel tiring and I genuinely just wanted to get to the story and finish the game. Run forward, get locked into battle arena, identify enemy weakness, activate appropriate abilities, smash through, mini execution cutscene (can be disabled), repeat for other enemies, continue through map, repeat the entire process. Pick up the insta-item use skill, slap on some defense equips, and just heal through damage if needed. So, I feel even less incentivized to play NG+ if this is going to be the combat for the entire second playthrough.\\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed myself with this game. It\\u2019s a little extra at times\\u2026 Talk to your teammates and gift them items to sometimes watch cutscenes to build bond level to improve their abilities, the absolute mental dissonance between the ongoing plot and the character bond cutscenes\\u2026 but that\\u2019s not a huge detriment or anything. Gameplay is neat and the idea is pretty solid. You really feel cool as you begin to grasp and get better at the system. And the game and cutscenes look pretty awesome. Aesthetic on point! Not going to blow anybody\\u2019s mind, or be everyone\\u2019s cup of tea, but solid enough with part of your brain turned off.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.041050310042763195, \"joke\": 1, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"It's a good game.\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.018446321911275137, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"anime, the video-game.\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.03297474675079128, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Game's really good fr\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.024202967794595513, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"my first JRPG action game. easy controls and cool story/characters. will come back for a better review.\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.03985740823716626, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"I love the gameplay and the setting so far.

No matter if you have 1000 hours into it, it'll still tell you when you should use your powers to kill certain enemy. And you can't turn tips off. Also, there's prompt for photo mode all the time on your screen. Even during cutscenes.\\n[b]- Characters. [/b] \\nBasic anime-types. Outside a few more important characters, they have absolutely no character growth and it's hard to get attached to anyone even a little. And constantly telling you to do this and to do that. They are boring. \\n[b]- \\\"Dungeons\\u201d. [/b] \\nThese \\\"dungeons\\\", for lack of better word, are just linear paths where at regular interval enemies spawn, you kill these monsters (which are called \\\"Others\\\", by the way) move on, enemies, pick up usable, enemies, maybe cutscene and final enemies. \\n\\n[h1] INDIFFERENT / PROS[/h1]\\n[b]- Combat.

You need special materials to create the gifts to give to your party members which will then trigger the character episodes. The special materials have low drop rates and can only be farmed from special arena bosses. After several goes at the same boss, I still have zero of the one required material!

It looks like whoever wrote this story just goes on the internet, looks up all the most popular sci-fi tropes and stuff them all together without even realizing the mess they've made. There are numerous times during the story that I have found myself wondering if I have skipped over a few chapters or something, because nothing makes sense. Remember that interesting plot point that we introduced a few chapters ago and made a really big deal out of it? It's gone. You probably don't need to understand that anyways, or anything that's happening for that matter because we will soon introduce another completely unrelated, tropey and cheap plot twist to try and hook you on the story. Meanwhile, Yuito has the mental capacity of a toddler, even a tragedy happening right before his eyes is unable to sway or make him display any emotions that a normal human should have, and of course he's completely cool hanging out with his enemy right that afternoon for a cup of coffee because why not? People trying to kill him? No problem, but don't go insulting his favourite doll because then he will seriously get angry. At first, I was hyped to play both routes and understand the whole story from different perspectives, but now I don't even think that I will touch Kasane's route.\\n\\nThe combat is flashy and satisfying, I really love how different SAS enables different kind of gameplay approach to combat. The biggest problem is, however, instead of a smooth hack and slash experience, you will often time find yourself in situations where you are animation locked in a combo or action and unable to dodge the enemies' attack. Overtime, mobs and bosses become damage sponges that are very frustrating to play against, the mechanics themselves are simple, but it feels like you are just punching a wall over and over for 10+ minutes with no effects whatsoever. The upgrade system is also extremely unimaginative, instead of actual interesting perks, the abilities offered are getting up after being knocked down, double jump, doing an extra attack, or +5% damage etc.\\n\\nI usually don't write reviews so this is more of just some of my thoughts scrambled together, but I feel like I have to write this review because I am so disappointed. I have read a lot of articles and reviews about how good this game is, and I decided to grab it while on sale. I was blown away during the first few chapters of the game, the art, combat and story are all promising to be a blast, but i guess it apparently didn't turn out that way.

Only on sale, let me explain why\\n\\nThe game consists of two characters, each has a different personality and style of combat, but play somewhat the same, to understand the story you need to play both (I recommend playing Yuito first), each has teammates that have different abilites to aid you in combat. To make their abilities better you need to increase your bond with them via \\\"bond episodes\\\" and giving gifts.\\n\\nThe gameplay i would describe as being 30% fighting, 70% cutscenes. So if the story is of your liking, you'll love this game, otherwise it might get a bit tedious (you can always skip them though). There's also a bit of exploration that rewards you with materials to craft better weapons/exchange for gifts to increase your bond. But apart from that grinding isn't necessary unless you want to get all achievements.\\nYour character will start weak as fuck, so you'll need to level up a bit to get some basic abilities (like getting up after being knocked, or double jump).\\n\\nThe characters are okay, their personalities can be a little cliche but that's what tends to happen in most games anyways, you can know them better via bond episodes, or just by the way they talk to you and each other while you're playing.\\n\\nThe story is pretty confusing at first, because a lot of questions you might have are left unanswered in your first playthrough, and the game just keeps adding more and more details that can be a bit hard to keep up, and even after playing both characters i still don't understand some things. Also the story can get kinda sad at times,  so you might cry.\\n\\nThe world has a sci-fi vibe which is one of the best parts of the game, just playing through the game and looking at the landscape of each area is one of the highlights of the game.\\n\\nDepending on how you play, it'll take you between 25-35 hours to play each character (i took 30 for Yuito, and 20 for Kasane as i skipped exploration and the cutscenes i already saw).\\n\\nSo in conclusion, i'd say give it a try if you manage to get it on discount or in a bundle. The game is ok I had fun playing through it, but it get tedious at times and you might force yourself to finish it, maybe it'll the combat, the story, the cutscenes, etc. But it was an enjoyable experience.

Super super fun and great story beats and pacing throughout so far.\\n\\nUPDATE 2023: Still think about this game and must say it's safely in my top 5 (behind Persona 5, PM & the Thousand Year Door and BOTW, in no particular order). The only issue I have is that I have no motive to play the second storyline, as a lot of the events that happen in the other plot feel explained to the other perspective exposition-style. It's not completely lost, but still worth noting considering the advertising of playing 2 perspectives to gain a full synopsis. Still, the 1 storyline I played through was really memorable and had some really beautiful and thrilling moments.\\n\\nWhen reading other reviews on the game, a lot of people seem to think the latter half of the game is a bit meh. I disagree, as sometimes even the best shows have stellar first halfs with more subdued ends. While SN's second half isn't \\\"subdued\\\", it is a bit less hectic with more and more of the mystery unraveling.\\n\\nAnd, the gameplay is stellar! Some JRPGs forget about gameplay, but I feel the combat loop is one of the best I've experienced from the genre (experience with Tales, Persona, Nier and Astral Chain, of which I'd rank SN somewhere in the middle of these games/franchises).\\n\\nWith all that said, I think this game is worth the price. Note: I got this game from humble bundle, so I did not pay this exact value. But, if I had known more about this game beforehand, I would say a retail value is worth it. Plus, it's on sale a fair amount so anything over 50% off is a major boon.

If you aren't using an xbox controller, you may have messed up controls. On top of that, you can't change your confirm/cancel button and certain buttons, you can't change, so if you try to fix your controls via a third party app or steam's button swapping, you end up with a different set of issues.\\n\\nFor an action based game, controls are very important and honestly, the controls could be greatly improved.\\n\\nAnother issue is that difficulty is subpar. You basically have the typical \\\"more hp and more damage = harder\\\" mindset here.\\n\\nOh, also, certain things require you to either watch the anime or find a cheat sheet that gives you the answers from the anime, probably in a bid to make you pay for the anime. Not a fan of that.\\n\\nThe storytelling is a bit annoying, especially if you want to read at your own pace. Not sure if there is some obscure command somewhere to fix that, but I didn't notice any fix for the auto advance (ironically, what I wish I could skip doesn't have a skip button). I did find an auto off, but you can only turn it on/off outside of story mode... which is usually when you'd want to switch.\\n\\nThe events are nothing novel and everything is extremely predictable (the game is very much stereotypical, which isn't a bad thing in and of itself), so don't go into this expecting some amazing story. It uses tried and true formulas, so it is just another reskin of such stories. Granted, the game also does a lot of foreshadowing and doesn't really hide that it is foreshadowing.\\n\\nThe combat is an action type combat, but just be aware that it isn't necessarily a button mash (hack and slash). At the same time, the controls just aren't quite right for what the devs seemed to be going for. At least on a controller.  Personally, it feels like they tried to take the best of all worlds and ended up just taking random bits and pieces instead.\\n\\nNow, visually, the game is good.

I wrote a review about this game but I felt like I needed to give it a second chance... and here I am to tell you not to buy this, now with better words. \\n\\nSCARLET NEXUS tries to be a lot of things and fun isn't one of them. The combat is the only thing that tries to shine but when the game explicitly doesn't want you to have fun, it simply fails miserably.\\n\\nWhat do I mean? Oh, it's probably the worst decision I've ever seen in a game where high octane combat is the main selling point - dodging is awful. You can't cancel your attacks and if you get knocked down, if not dodging, your character takes their sweet ass time, close to 6 seconds to get up.\\n\\nAlso, 80% of the enemies are designed for you to use your allies powers but if they weren't in such an annoying cooldown, things would've been better. You can't unleash your combos because the enemy saw you, hid inside their pants and if you continue to attack, you will deal no damage to them and guess what? You have to turn invisible to hit them and now you're allowed to inflict little to no damage! Yay!\\nThe damage your character does is laughable, even at higher levels. It's beyond infuriating how these enemies negate your attacks, it's like playing Yu-Gi-Oh! and every card you play gets Ash Blossom'd. Plus, these enemies get recycled a LOT and the bosses are just some anime people. \\nThere's no secret bosses, no extra dungeons or anything of the sorts either. The last boss is just... meh. The big statue part is cool but everything else is lame since you fight this dude named Karen multiple times during the game as well. Yes, his name is Karen and no, he isn't interesting nor wants to speak to any managers because he doesn't have enough charisma for that.\\n\\nTalking about the unvaried anime people, oh gods... I've played as Kasane and I've never seen a more unlikeable main character. She has her personal issues and stuff and never lets anyone gets close but... the bonding system requires the character to be at least friendly, and it feels so forced to see the other characters saying \\\"oh thank you so much for being my friend!\\\" when she's doing the absolute bare minimum a friend should do, and still feels she doesn't feel like she cares. Think of her as an even more emotional unavailable Lightning from FF13.\\nEveryone else is plain as a door, including the other main character Yuito. Dude is incredibly boring and I'm not gonna lie, I've skipped almost everything story related because I couldn't handle how uninteresting the setting was... well, except for Tsugumi because I found her cute. Waifus, am I right?\\n\\nOh yea, to increase your allies abilities you need to BOND with them. It's such, but such a slog; it feels like playing a freemium game but the currency you spend is time, the only thing you don't get back.\\n\\nThere's a crafting system but it's as barebones as one could get. Just... whatever, who cares.\\n\\nWith that said, I needed to justify my purchase and powered through this dull excuse of a game with a trainer. Sue me, alright? I wanted my money's worth and joke's on me because I still feel ripped off, even playing with no cooldowns, overleved characters and not getting hit. Yes, the game still feels like a drag even with cheats. It's absolutely ridiculous how many unnecessary hurdles the game creates. Ice level? Oh there's some ice barriers for no f**king reason for you to spend time hitting and ruin the pacing of the action, or lack thereof.\\n\\nWhatever, this game sucks.

I really enjoy the almost comic book style that most of the story is told as. Though, what really makes it engaging is when a full on animated cinematic is weaved into the story telling as well. The art style is very appealing, and I love the detail in not only the outfits, but also the environment. I love the feel and the aesthetics  of it all.\\nI started from the male protagonist's perspective of the story, so I am not sure if it is different from the females perspective, but it seems like that may be the case.\\n\\nThe combat is a big one for me. It is very engaging. There are lots of combos, and tricks to discover. It's flashy, entertaining, and it doesn't get boring or repetitive. I find myself looking for objects in the environment to interact with for the psychokinesis abilities, and ways to combo status effects with my current teammates. There is a lot to the combat and the game does a great job at teaching new facets, and integrating them into the environment and your teammates that they introduce 1 or 2 at a time so that it never feels overwhelming. \\n\\nThe personalities of the characters are rather wide, and though there are a lot of characters in this game it doesn't feel too overwhelming. I am excited to not only enjoy the rpg aspects of this game, but also to explore the story telling and character development that is already an evident focus. It's also cool that you can unlock combat abilities through building relationships with your squad mates. This is a nice take on getting you to explore the story, while also being rewarded with bonus combat mechanics.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.21515059265571948, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"---{Graphics}---\\n\\u2610 You forget what reality is\\n\\u2610 Beautiful\\n\\u2611 Good\\n\\u2610 Decent\\n\\u2610 Bad\\n\\u2610 Don\\u2018t look too long at it\\n\\u2610 MS-DOS\\n\\n---{Gameplay}---\\n\\u2610 Very good\\n\\u2611 Good\\n\\u2610 It\\u2018s just gameplay\\n\\u2610 Mehh\\n\\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\\n\\u2610 Just don't\\n\\n---{Audio}---\\n\\u2610 Eargasm\\n\\u2611 Very good\\n\\u2610 Good\\n\\u2610 Not too bad\\n\\u2610 Bad\\n\\u2610 I'm now deaf\\n\\n---{Audience}---\\n\\u2610 Kids\\n\\u2611 Teens\\n\\u2610 Adults\\n\\u2610 All\\n\\n---{PC Requirements}---\\n\\u2610 Check if you can run paint\\n\\u2610 Potato\\n\\u2611 Decent\\n\\u2610 Fast\\n\\u2610 Rich boi\\n\\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\\n\\n---{Difficulty}---\\n\\u2610 Just press 'W'\\n\\u2610 Easy\\n\\u2610 Significant brain usage\\n\\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\\n\\u2610 Difficult\\n\\u2610 Dark Souls\\n\\n---{Grind}---\\n\\u2610 Nothing to grind\\n\\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\\n\\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\\n\\u2611 Average grind level\\n\\u2610 Too much grind\\n\\u2610 You\\u2018ll need a second live for grinding\\n\\n---{Story}---\\n\\u2610 No Story\\n\\u2610 Some lore\\n\\u2610 Average\\n\\u2610 Good\\n\\u2611  Lovely\\n\\u2610 It\\u2018ll replace your life\\n\\n---{Game Time}---\\n\\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\\n\\u2610 Short\\n\\u2610 Average\\n\\u2611  Long\\n\\u2610 To infinity and beyond\\n\\n---{Price}---\\n\\u2610 It\\u2019s free!\\n\\u2611 Worth the price\\n\\u2610 If u have some spare money left\\n\\u2610 Not recommended\\n\\u2610 You could also just burn your money\\n\\n---{Bugs}---\\n\\u2611 Never heard of\\n\\u2610 Minor bugs\\n\\u2610 Can get annoying\\n\\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\\n\\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\\n\\n---{Comments}---\\nGet it on sale. 60% off is literally free for what you get!\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.028189570938798793, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"50/50 gameplay and narrative, so be prepared to have your fighting interrupted by dialog frequently.\\n\\nThe areas are pretty linear and the combat repetitive, but overall a fun and interesting game.

Skill allowing you to use 4 SAS abilities concurrently - Pointless and makes management of active powers a real bother. Having only two active powers and overwriting last active powers allows for fast and effective skill switching. In some combination of active skills you need to only input one command (activate) instead of two (deactivate ability + activate).\\n2. Skill allowing you to use [Y+B] combo in Brain Drive - makes you just to OP\\n3.

At least you are not supposed to fight mostly 3 types of enemies like in Nier:Automata.

You barely know the major player and faction in the story but they escalate the story way too fast that all of it does not make sense. They put twist just for the sake of twist.\\n\\n The map is what should I say, you might as well make them mission based since the map is pointless.

You just spam one combo and you can plow through the entire game.\\nKasane and Yuito are marketed as feeling different from each other, but other than Kasane playing from range using her floating knives and Yuito favors close-and-personal combo attacks, they don't really play that different.\\n\\nThe environments on both the dungeons and towns looks amazing and practical. You always know where to go, and never got lost. Towns are very useless tho. There's literally nothing to do in town except for story reasons and taking sidequests.

It looks great, it has nice tunes and its combat system looks stylish and fun. But then, the more of it I\\u2019ve played, the more I grew frustrated and bored. And in the end, even though I\\u2019m a huge fan of games where you have two playable characters going through two parallel storylines, I couldn\\u2019t keep on playing with the second character. I just didn\\u2019t have it in me to play more of it. Yet, what a fascinating project this is.\\n\\nAt the first glance, you might think that Scarlet Nexus is the kind of a Japanese action RPG that leans heavily into fun hack and slash mechanics, like what you\\u2019d get in recent (and highly enjoyable) Ys titles. We get all of the recognizable elements of a game like that \\u2013 a perfect dodge that slows time and gives you a chance to counter, two types of attack, combos, special attacks. And on top of that, you throw things around with your playable character, which is incredibly fun and can enhance the flow of the fight. Then you also get the cool finishers and additional movement abilities and as your party grows, the special abilities that are tied to the party members get even more fun and creative.\\n\\nAnd yet, if you try to play this game as a fast paced hack and slash, you will die a lot. The thing is \\u2013 this game isn\\u2019t actually an Ys type of game, or even a Final Fantasy VII Remake type of game. It\\u2019s far closer to Final Fantasy XV or \\u201cLightning Returns\\u201d in terms of how it plays. Meaning that while you input typical hack and slash combos, they work more like traditional jRPG menu commands that cannot be interrupted. Started a combo? Can\\u2019t move or dodge until the animation finishes. Started any special animation? Locked into it until it\\u2019s done. Or you get hit. To be fair, if you decide to start with Kasane as your first character, her fighting style is more in line with what the game wants to be, but even there it feels flawed. While Yuito controls just like your typical hack and slash anime swordsman, except really unresponsive when it matters.\\n\\nThe approach to the combat the game has isn\\u2019t bad, when you play it \\u201cas intended\\u201d and you can still pull some fun combinations, all while looking cool af. Problem is \\u2013 the way the game wants to be paced is slow and tedious. Its main gameplay is basically divided into two main parts \\u2013 the cutscenes that are presented in a nice stop-frame style (mixed with realtime from time to time), and the fights. Sure, there are bits of exploration as well and even the social element, but both elements are very simplified and are nothing but lead-ins into the two main parts. And since there\\u2019s so much fighting going on all the time, you really want to speed it up and play fast, like one would in a hack and slash. And it actually can work in many spots. But not everywhere and most certainly not during boss fights. Which require you to just stop attacking and run away (or wait for the perfect dodge moment) as soon as the enemy is preparing the attack.\\n\\nThis could be more fun if this slower, more methodical pace, gelled well with the music, the animations, the \\u201ccoolness\\u201d and the damage output of your party, but it\\u2019s not. In fact, boss fights often take a lot of time to get through, all while you can die almost randomly. No joke \\u2013 you can go the entire boss fight without getting damaged, at full health, and then attack at a bad time or not dodge correctly and then get stuck in a failure state until your health is at zero. Dying before you even get the control over your character back. And needing to replay this otherwise very simple and samey fight again. It\\u2019s genuinely strange how much better the game is when it allows you to just go fast and destroy enemies with quick and precise combos and yet, that\\u2019s not how it\\u2019s intended to be played. And the game would eventually punish you for that approach.\\n\\nSimilar confusion is caused by the story. Scarlet Nexus has a really cool (both visually and conceptually) world and there are many points in the story where you catch glimpses of what amazing themes could be explored. But then the game goes for a basic trope instead. The characters have interesting traits, but are instead treated as predictable anime stereotypes. The storytelling suffers from the typical \\u201coverexplain things to the players as often as you can\\u201d issue lots of Japanese RPGs have, where you learn one simple fact during a story chapter and then this fact gets regurgitated for the next 10 minutes, adding nothing to the story or the characters. And in the end, the story is far less exciting than what it could be. Though, damn if it isn\\u2019t stylish and accompanied by some great memorable tunes.\\n\\nI wish I could straight up recommend Scarlet Nexus, because I feel like it does have some cool concepts. I just don\\u2019t think they were developed the way they should\\u2019ve been. Maybe the dev team couldn\\u2019t decide upon the direction they wanted. Maybe they couldn\\u2019t nail the gameplay. Or maybe they got exactly what they wanted and I just didn\\u2019t find it fun enough. There\\u2019s a chance you will enjoy the gameplay much more than I did. Scarlet Nexus is definitely worth checking out, just keep your expectations right and don\\u2019t try to play it as a fast paced Ys-like game. Because it isn\\u2019t.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.02146048029263369, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\",

\"review_type\": \"Negative\", \"review_text\": \"I wish this game had shown it's true colors from the start. I bought the edition with all of the DLC, and this was honestly a total waste.\\n\\nTLDR: The gameplay is a great concept piece, but it doesn't shine until endgame, and the story is an absolute mess, on top of the writing being awkward and genuinely really gross in some parts, like calling a Shota's body beautiful. Yeah because that's... not creepy.\\n\\nGraphically, it's an anime game and you get what you get from that. Heavily stylized and looks like an anime, what more can you want? The only problem is that many enemies are just carbon copies of other enemies, so you end up with the Mass Effect Andromeda problem; you're fighting the same three enemies throughout the entire game. This is also a gameplay problem, but it also makes the enemies boring to look at after awhile. It ultimately drags the game down into mediocre territory\\n\\nSound design wise, the game is pretty behind on trends; which is fine. Dubstep has a place in the world, and it works well given the atmosphere of the game. The Hard Rock bits are jammin', the Jazzy tracks are snappy.  The combat sounds all sound great. So overall sound design is above average.\\n\\nThe gameplay feels mostly fantastic. The combat is responsive, flows well, you feel powerful and it has a good learning curve. The skill tree is expansive, and the moves are all extremely stylish. If you look at the videos, and like the look of the gameplay, you'll enjoy it. The main issues are: You don't get your full party until the end of the game; so there's really very little party customization until you're ready to start the next route. Although it goes inline with how the story plays out, it was a bad move. I'll talk about more as to why that is in the story segment. The other problem is: The dungeons are awful. I mean just TERRIBLE. Point A to point B, everything is bland and boring, sometime it slaps you with back tracking just to make you go get a key card. Like, why? That isn't a dynamic situation at all, it's just prolonging a boring aspect of the game. If this game ever gets a sequel, I hope for better dungeons and party customization.\\n\\nThe story is easily the worst thing about this game, and drags the whole thing down with it. It's so busy trying to be complex that it forgets to actually be complex. There's a logical fallacy within the START of the narrative that makes it all pointless to begin with; just to allow everything be driven by emotion; which doesn't even make sense given that I'm fairly sure [spoiler] Kasane has aspergers. She thinks VERY logically but she keeps failing to think logically [/spoiler] . The logical fallacy is as follows (and is a huge spoiler), [spoiler] She could go back in time and change everything by doing a couple of different things. She could go back and prevent her own birth or kill Yuito; or she could also go back in time once after the true death of her sister, prevent her sister from being turned into an Other, then when the world starts to fall apart and she goes through her likely emotional breakdown by watching the fall of the universe, she could go back to the initial moment where she and Yuito travelled back in time, prevent Yuito from reaching into the Red Strings with Kasane, and then SURPRISE! Everyone lives, AND there's no apocalypse at all!: Another problem being that the rift wouldn't kill everyone. Everyone and everything would just end up at the other side of the rift, which means that another dimension would house them. A \\\"Gravitational anomaly\\\" doesn't make sense within the constructs of a dimensional portal. The writers wanted to make a sci fi epic without doing any of the research that goes into writing a sci fi epic and it absolutely shows. [/spoiler] So in reality, nothing happening should be happening at all, and you're just being forced into it because they want it to be an emotionally driven story; and it ends up affecting the game by preventing you from having the party that you would like to have.\\n\\nIf you truly love sci-fi, well designed dungeons, open party composition, and a logically written story and true enemy diversity, look elsewhere. If you're looking for an emotionally driven story that doesn't take a lot of thought, and you just straight up love anime, you might love this game.\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.3323056433502429, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Negative\", \"review_text\": \"Couldn't get into this game, there are many characters (which is good) but they don't add nothing meaningful, in fact they're all cliches (The smart guy, the shy girl, the strong fella, etc)\\n\\nCombat is good, you can use the special abilities of your companions but the dynamic when fighting human enemies is pretty repetivive (hit and run)\\n\\nThe story is what killed my interest, it is pretty formulaic, you fight monsters and then you stay at your hub with your friends to talk about meaningless stuff.

If you look at the Wikipedia, as of February 2022, you will notice there is no plot summary. I believe this is because no one who has played understands what actually happened in the 24 hours of gameplay. Reading the Time Cube website is an easier task that trying to make sense of this game's plot. Also the primary enemies of the game, the \\\"Others\\\" look like they were designed by Tim Burton fan blogs on Tumblr. They have a fairly coherent design theme, but it's pretty out there and it's never explained why they look this way so I can only assume it's because the devs thought they would look cool and never felt the need to justify why they look like amalgamations of random inanimate objects.\\n\\nAnd it's not just arbitrary plot points brought up for the purpose of going \\\"OOOO ANIME SCIFI WOOOAH :soyface:\\\" The interpersonal points of the story make no sense. There are literally parts in this game where you're fighting other characters who will then immediately invite you to go hang and chill with them at some stupid bar like nothing ever happened. It completely breaks any sense of immersion and actually made me skip cutscenes, not out of boredom but of actual rage at how little sense the plot was making.\\n\\nAside from that, the gameplay is mostly solid but I don't think I enjoyed a single boss fight. The SAS mechanic is pretty enjoyable once you get the hang of it. So if you don't care stories in games, you'll probably get at least some enjoyment out of this one. I would wait for it to go on sale though.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.03794013763597366, \"joke\": 1, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"10/10 would sex :D\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.042379667142743896, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Story line is good but it is too long at the end.

Then I got the game. I really dislike it. Extremely stale, cliche, boring plot. Extremely lackluster characters, even for a standard jrpg. Its the kind of game that would have benefitted from a CaC as opposed to a main character who states that his main interests are housework and collecting keychains. The other character is only slightly better. \\n\\nSo, the core combat is all the game has going for it. In the demo, it was amazing. In the real game, you have to spend upgrade points on basic stuff no other game makes you do. Like getting up after being attacked is an UPGRADE. Double jump is an upgrade. Having more than three standard attacks is a costly upgrade. Increasing your damage by 5% is a costly upgrade. Extremely underwhelming especially within the confines of the game. There's no block, so making mobility a factor behind a costly upgrade wall makes no sense, The characters are slow and stilted. The environments are too drab to have me running slowly through them.\\n\\n The melee character has zero staggering ability with his normal attacks, so playing up close is not very viable. I never felt stronger, even halfway through the game. The saving grace is the support system where you can use other character's powers momentarily. It is very fun. It's the only reason I played through half the game. However, in order to use these powers, you have to collect and give gifts to these super lame characters and endure long \\\"bonding episodes\\\" that I now always skip. Unbearable.

One of the best anime action RPGs. [/h1]\\n\\nI already knew this was going to be a great game before it came out and was not surprised at all after getting the chance to play it, and yes this is a great game.\\n\\nThe story is split between two main characters, Yuito and Kasane and you get to choose who to play as in the beginning. I don\\u2019t think it really matters who you play as first or in which order as they\\u2019re both great though I played the Yuito story first and then played the Kasane story because I somehow felt like doing it. Also another thing regarding the story, it would be best if you played BOTH characters and stories if you want to get the complete story, since both characters have their own unique story lines and scenes that intertwine and connect, and thus there may be gaps in the story that you may not understand if you only played one of the stories. The story itself is alright, I found it a bit weird at times but still fine for the most part.\\n\\nThe gameplay is excellent. The fighting and combat in this game is top tier in a way that you can perform many different kinds of attacks and combinations using different powers and abilities creating a dynamic, fun and engaging variety of methods to take out enemies. The combat also encourages the player to make use of their surroundings to their advantage like using certain objects around the environment to attack enemies in very cool ways. It is addicting and I never got bored of it at all and this is where this game shines the most in my opinion.\\n\\nThe characters are interesting and their bonding events are also equally interesting as you learn more about their personalities and their other selves. The environment is also very cool looking, especially the city area and the soundtrack is also pretty decent.\\n\\nIn regards to the two main characters, personally I think Yuito has a better combat and attack style while Kasane has a better story perspective and personality. Either way, they\\u2019re both great characters.\\n\\nHowever there seems to be some criticism from people who claim that there is too much dialogue in this game and it feels like it\\u2019s a visual novel at times but personally I don\\u2019t see the big deal. Most anime games tend to have a lot of dialogue and overall the large amount of dialogue in this game doesn\\u2019t take away the game\\u2019s immersion at all as the dialogues are also quite interesting. But if you\\u2019re the person who doesn\\u2019t like reading and listening through plenty of dialogues, then I suppose I can understand why you might not like this game.\\n\\nOverall though, the pros outweigh the cons here and this is definitely something worth playing, for both anime and non-anime fans, though anime fans would probably appreciate this more.\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.017988666845047043, \"joke\": 1, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"Love this game.

Many good, some not-so-good, but overall I had a lot more fun with this game than I thought I would and I would love to see more people try it out.\\n\\nThis game is gorgeous; it's probably my favorite anime-styled game from a graphical standpoint. It's a shame that the fully animated cutscenes are so few and far in-between. I don't mind the cut-in comic/visual novel style that the cutscenes are primarily presented with, but the scenes with full animation are so mindblowing and fun to watch that it just makes me wish they invested more resources in having more of them.\\n\\nThe gameplay is fluid and very satisfying to play. I never turned off the animations for the Brain Crushes because I loved watching them so much. The game gets even better once you unlock more abilities through the Brain Map, especially the ones that allow you to activate more SAS powers at once. There is some repetition with the way you need to handle certain types of enemies, especially towards the end of the game where it seems to throw the really meaty, high-HP ones at you nonstop, but it never felt like too much of a drag to me. Both Yuito and Kasane felt good to play as and, by the end of the game, I didn't have a preference over who I liked to play more. I do think that the game could've benefited from having more varied enemy types, or enemies that can be taken down in several different ways (rather than just defaulting to 1 or 2 SAS powers.) The game's side quests are also pretty weak and aren't well-integrated into the main game, as they require the player to go out their way to deliberately kill certain enemies in specific ways that I wouldn't exactly consider rewarding or fun. However, the addition of Challenges in a previous patch makes these quests a little more worth doing. I do also applaud them for adding in an extra layer of difficulty in both the new difficulty mode added in with the last patch and the Missions mode, it's good news for those who wanted to play the game in a more advanced way.\\n\\nThe story certainly isn't perfect, and this is the area of the game I have more mixed opinions on. I felt that certain plot twists towards the end of the game put a damper on what it has going on earlier on, but I wouldn't say that it straight up ruins it. And due to the nature of the split-routes between the protagonists, the story is told in a somewhat disjointed way and its presentation between routes is not equal. The developers swear that you can start the game with whoever you prefer, but I strongly disagree. Yuito's route feels almost deliberately tailored towards people who are starting the game for the first time, while Kasane's route feels like it was meant for people who have cleared the game already. This is because Kasane's route rids itself of any plot intrigue almost immediately; plot twists that felt like a big deal in Yuito's route are just dropped onto your lap with little fanfare in Kasane's route, almost as if the game expects you to know them already. People who start the game with Kasane with no knowledge of the events in Yuito's route will have a very different experience with the story that might be less than satisfactory. There are also issues with the late-game in both routes having very little differences between each other once they \\\"merge.\\\" This is why I recommend starting with Yuito first over Kasane if you care about the story, but I feel that I shouldn't have to say something like this for a game that boasts this type of feature. \\nThe game's \\\"rest periods\\\" -- interludes that take place between every chapter -- also happen too often and can break the pacing of the game. I felt that they should've been spread further apart to allow for more smooth storytelling and to make the tasks during these interludes (such as viewing Bond Episodes and doing quests) feel more worthwhile and less like a chore. \\n\\nNow, about the characters: they are fairly charming on their own. There are many reviews that claim they're \\\"trope-y,\\\" and while I agree to some extent, I don't think it's a bad thing. It's very easy for me to grow exhausted with tropes and cliches that are ever-present in most JRPGs, but I feel that this game avoids the worst of those tropes. The characters easy to grow attached to and fun to watch, especially during Bond Episodes or when they're interacting with each other in the field. The Bond Episodes that are included in the DLC packs are especially entertaining! If you want really nuanced characters with deep storylines backing them, you probably won't find it here, but they do their job as a supporting cast more than well enough.\\n\\nI also wanted to include a little section dedicated to talking about the Season Pass and whether or not one should purchase it, and my answer is Yes. The DLC packs include Bond Episodes and abilities that enhance the gameplay (not by a substantial amount, but they're extremely useful if you want to tackle the hardest Missions the game has to offer.) The cosmetics are a little sub-par; I like the \\\"casual\\\" set from the second pack, but I wish that the outfits were more unique and individualized rather than being copypastes of each other or recolors of the default outfits. And finally, the Karen-centric story episodes added in with the final pack are an absolute treat to watch if you were invested in the story and/or had issues with certain plot holes. They will take a long time to fully unlock if you haven't yet cleared the game, and the Mission that goes with it is easily the hardest fight in the entire game, but they're very much worth spending the time to watch. \\n\\nWith the release of the final DLC pack, I can finally say with confidence that Scarlet Nexus is pretty great. I played this game on Day 1, and the content they've added in since then definitely make it worth the price now. My best advice is to buy the game on sale along with the Season Pass for the best possible value, as I do recommend getting the Season Pass if you want a more worthwhile experience.\", \"helpful\": \"Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.025362743665786662, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"combat is super awesome and the battles have a good level of difficulty, story is average but good, overall epic game\", \"helpful\": \"Not Helpful\", \"helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\", \"Helpful?\": \"Not Helpful\"}, {\"helpfulness_score\": 0.04575748637628748, \"joke\": 0, \"review_type\": \"Positive\", \"review_text\": \"The game has some cheesiness and oh god why are enemies named like that, but the story is solid, the characters are nice, and THE WORLD IS SO AMAZING AND INTERESTING I WISH THERE WAS MORE LORE AROUND IT.
